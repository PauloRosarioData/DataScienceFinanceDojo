Introduction: Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight
We have launched a new Scamsmart campaign with The Pensions Regulator (TPR) to raise awareness of pension scams and urging the public to be cautious when approached about their pension. Pension savers can be targeted by highly sophisticated scammers who steal on average, £91,000 per scam. Victims can lose their life savings and be left with limited income when nearing retirement.  
The group most at risk is pension holders aged 45-65. New research shows that a third do not know how to check whether they are speaking with a legitimate pensions provider or adviser. Research has also revealed that 1 in 8 pension holders aged 45-65 are likely to trust an offer of a ‘free pension review’ – a tactic frequently used by scammers to lure pension savers into a scam.  
The FCA reviews and assesses all reports received about unauthorised pension activities which are very often linked to these types of pension scams. This year the Unauthorised Business Department commenced proceedings against 2 unregulated pension introducers involved in the transfer of at least £86 million in pension assets from over 2000 consumers. The FCA is seeking injunctions, declarations and restitution orders to prevent further breaches in schemes which were unlawfully promoted to the public using false, misleading and deceptive statements.  
The new campaign urges consumers to be ScamSmart and to check they are dealing with an authorised firm if they are considering changing their pension arrangements. 
The campaign launched on 14 August 2018 with TV, radio and online advertising. The advertising will be supported by PR, and partnership activity with a wide range of organisations. If you would like to support the campaign, you can download resources on the ScamSmart site.
Find out more about the campaign here.

Hot topics
Accessible communications for consumers
Our recently published Approach to Consumers sets out our vision for well-functioning markets. Key to this is that the needs of all consumers, including vulnerable consumers are considered. Our Approach to Consumers sets out the key drivers of potential vulnerability – health, life events, financial resilience and capability. 
One way firms can help potentially vulnerable consumers is to ensure that their services are accessible and easy to use. For example, the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) explain that every day 250 people start to lose their sight. As financial services are increasingly online, it is important to make sure people with visual impairments are not disadvantaged.
As a regulator it is important that we make our work and campaigns accessible for vulnerable consumers. That is why, for example, as part of our PPI campaign we have produced leaflets in a range of formats, including braille, large font and audio, as well as animation videos with information available in different languages, including British Sign Language. We worked directly with the RNIB and Visionary to share our message and carry out user testing with a range of users, including visually impaired consumers, to make our website easier to access and compatible with screen readers.
Accessibility benefits everyone, not just the vulnerable. We expect firms to ensure their communications are accessible to consumers by providing choice in how they communicate and ensuring that communications are designed in an inclusive way.
To make our expectations clear and ensure good outcomes for consumers, we will be consulting on guidance for firms on the identification and treatment of vulnerable consumers. As part of this, we are hosting an event to explore how to make financial services work well for consumers in vulnerable circumstances on 18 September 2018. For further information, please email [email protected] 
Preparing your firm for Brexit
 
As the UK prepares to leave the EU, FCA solo regulated firms should consider if or how they will be affected and what action they may need to take. Firms need to make sure they understand the implications of Brexit and plan accordingly.
Passporting currently allows firms authorised in an EEA state to conduct business within other EEA states based on their ‘home’ member state authorisation. After Brexit, and any implementation period, passporting in its current form will end for the financial firms currently using it in the UK. This may change depending on any future agreement with the EU.
This will affect:
firms and funds based in the UK that conduct business in the EEA
firms and funds based in the EEA that carry out certain types of business in the UK
There are questions on our website that may help you decide if you conduct business in the EEA or if Brexit might affect your business. If you think that you are affected by Brexit you should:
Work out what changes you might have to make to your business or which additional regulatory permissions you may need to continue to carry it out.
Think about any information you will need to give to customers who might be affected by your plans and how you can provide it in a way which is clear, fair and not misleading. For example, explaining clearly to customers where a change in contractual terms might affect them.
Consider the implications of a range of possible scenarios including an implementation period.
You may also want to discuss the implications with the relevant EEA regulator in the countries in which you do business, your trade association or get independent legal advice for further clarification.
Track your Connect application – live soon 
As you may be aware from our Approach to Authorisation, we want to ensure that our regulation evolves with financial services and that we continue to develop our systems and processes to meet the requirements of the firms we regulate.  
Your feedback helps shape this, and helps us understand what is important to you.  
In September, we are launching new functionality in the Connect system. It will give greater visibility of your application, and allow you to track its progress. When you log in, you’ll be able to see helpful information depending on the type of application you have submitted.  
We are also launching a new look and feel to Connect which will make the system more intuitive to use. This will be a beta version which will allow you to switch back to the current view if you prefer.
We will be providing more information about this exciting, new change in the upcoming weeks.

Digital regulatory reporting
We are continuing our work with the Bank of England (BoE) on a 6 month pilot to build upon the Proof of Concept developed at our November TechSprint on digital regulatory reporting. The pilots are evaluating the feasibility of scaling the work from the TechSprint considering 2 use cases. One is focusing on retail reporting and the other on wholesale reporting.  
We will be holding 2 open demonstration and Q&A sessions to give attendees an opportunity to understand the technological, governance and legal decisions made throughout and allow an opportunity to critique and review the work. The open days will be held on 22 August and 28 September. Please email [email protected] if you would like to attend either session.
Service metrics
Following action by the FCA and the Competition and Markets Authority, consumers and small businesses will have better information about the services offered by current account providers. From 15 August, the FCA is requiring these firms to provide standard information on:
how often they have had to report major operational and security incidents
levels of complaints against them
how and when their services are available
how customers can contact them for help

An evaluation of our add-on guaranteed asset protection insurance intervention
We have published the first of a new series of evaluations of our past interventions. We committed to these in our Mission. We have evaluated our September 2015 add-on Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) insurance intervention. This intervention looked to reduce consumer harm that we identified in our General insurance add-ons market study.
Our evaluation found that the intervention has had a positive impact. After our intervention, consumers engage more with the decision-making process when buying GAP Insurance, with shopping around more than doubling.

Call for Input: PRIIPs Regulation – initial experiences with the new requirements
Last month we published our Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPs) Call for Input. We are inviting firms and consumers to provide input on their initial experiences of the requirements introduced by the Regulation. 
The PRIIPs Regulation requires certain firms to prepare and provide investors with standardised key information documents (KIDs). It aims to improve consumer understanding and outcomes by standardising the disclosures retail investors receive, giving them the ability to compare competing products.  
We would like to hear from those who are producing, advising on, or distributing PRIIPs (and preparing and providing KIDs), and from consumers now using KIDs to decide whether to invest in these investment products.  
This Call for Input covers questions around the scope of the PRIIPs Regulation, and around the content of KIDs. We invite firms and consumers to tell us about their experiences of the required disclosures. We also invite input on any other practical experiences with the PRIIPs Regulation.

The pilots are evaluating the feasibility of scaling the work from the TechSprint considering 2 use cases. One is focusing on retail reporting and the other on wholesale reporting.  
We will be holding 2 open demonstration and Q&A sessions to give attendees an opportunity to understand the technological, governance and legal decisions made throughout and allow an opportunity to critique and review the work. The open days will be held on 22 August and 28 September. Please email [email protected] if you would like to attend either session.

Fintech & Innovative Businesses
Global Financial Innovation Network
In collaboration with 11 financial regulators and related organisations, we have announced the creation of the Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN). This builds on the FCA’s proposal earlier this year to create a ‘global sandbox’.
The network will seek to provide a more efficient way for innovative firms to interact with regulators, helping them navigate between countries as they look to scale new ideas. It will also create a new framework for co-operation between financial services regulators on innovation related topics, sharing different experiences and approaches.
The group has launched a consultation on the role the GFIN should play in delivering its objectives and we are inviting feedback by 14 October 2018.
We are keen to hear from all interested parties on the mission statement, how this network will work in practice, what it should prioritise and how regulators and other stakeholders can work together to take it forward.
We encourage innovative financial services firms, financial services regulators, technology companies, technology providers, trade bodies, accelerators, academia, consumer groups and other stakeholders keen on being part of the development of the GFIN to respond to the questions in the Global Financial Innovation Network paper.

Payment Service Providers
FCA consults on rules and guidance to improve conduct and communications in payment services and e-money firms
This month we are consulting on rules and guidance to improve conduct standards and communications in the payment services and e-money sectors.  
Consultation paper 18/21 proposes to extend the application of the FCA Principles for Businesses and certain specific rules about promotions and communications to cover wider categories of businesses that we regulate (including businesses authorised or registered under the Payment Services Regulations or the Electronic Money Regulations). 
We are also proposing new guidance to help ensure that firms do not mislead consumers when they are advertising payment services or e-money that involve a currency conversion. This delivers on a commitment we made last year, to act on concerns about firms’ use of currency converter tools in relation to their currency transfer services.  
We are seeking comments on the proposals by 1 November 2018.

EU Withdrawal
FCA’s role in preparing for EU withdrawal
Earlier in the summer we published an update on how we are preparing for the UK leaving the European Union. This includes setting out how we will amend EU binding technical standards (detailed EU rules) and our Handbook to ensure they can function effectively when the UK leaves the EU.
Temporary permissions regime
The Treasury published the statutory instrument on TPR on 24 July. We have provided more details on the TPR on our website for firms and funds currently passporting into the UK.
Statutory instruments
The Treasury set out its approach to amending financial services legislation under the EU (Withdrawal) Act on 27 June. It will use statutory instruments (SIs) to do this, and laid the first of these in July. The Treasury has since published further SIs, with more expected shortly. Firms do not need to prepare to implement this legislation now. Please see the Treasury website for more information.

Live & Local 2018/19 events programme announced
Continuing our successful Live & Local events programme that began in April 2016, we have launched our 2018/19 programme. From September 2018, we will be travelling across the UK with a new series of events for regulated firms. 
The first set of events will take place from September to December 2018. This year, we have added events for non-bank payment services firms as well as events for general insurance and mortgage firms.

Complaints handling case study and multi-firm review
We have published a hypothetical case study on complaints handling including root cause analysis. This is a tool to help respondent firms when reviewing and amending their complaint handling policies and procedures, particularly with understanding what good root cause analysis can look like. 
The hypothetical case study follows multi-firm work into complaints handling where we found that some firms did not conduct adequate complaints root cause analysis.
Annual public meeting 2018, Tuesday 11 September 2018, London
At the annual public meeting, we will discuss our 2017/18 Annual Report.

Senior Managers and Certification Regime – events for insurers
We are holding events on the Senior Managers and Certification Regime to help dual-regulated insurers prepare for commencement.
On 4 July, we published rules for how we will extend the Senior Managers and Certification Regime. The regime will begin for insurers on 10 December 2018.
For further information about the events and the new regime, please visit our events booking website.
Discussion Paper on duty of care
Alongside the Approach to Consumers, in July we published a Discussion Paper on a duty of care and the potential alternative approaches. Feedback to our Future Approach to Consumers consultation paper showed differing views and concerns, so it is important that we have an open discussion and debate about the potential merits of a duty of care.
In this Discussion Paper, we consider and seek views on alternative approaches that might address stakeholders’ concerns. To encourage views on this topic, we are hosting an event for firms on 26 September 2018 to discuss the questions in the paper.
For further information on the event, please email [email protected]. This Discussion Paper is open for consultation until 2 November 2018. You can also submit your views by email at the address above. 
New Securitisation Legislation for 1 January 2019
The Securitisation Regulation and related amendment to the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) came into force on 18 January 2018. Most of their provisions will come into effect on 1 January 2019. 
We are consulting on a number of changes to ensure that our Handbook is consistent with the directly applicable EU Securitisation Regulation and CRR amendment. For more information, please read CP18/22.

Making it easier to use and compare current accounts,News stories,15/08/2018,15/08/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/making-it-easier-use-and-compare-current-accounts,"What information is being published today
Under our new rules customers will be able to easily find standard information on providers’ websites about:
how and when services and helplines are available
contact details for help, including for 24 hour helplines
how often the firm has had to report major operational and security incidents
the published level of complaints made against the firm
Providers must publish the information on their websites in a consistent format and the large banks must also make this information available electronically via online Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). As facilitated by the ‘Open Banking’ initiative, APIs are an important route through which third parties can access current account service information.
Larger banks must publish information on how likely people would be to recommend their bank – as well its online and mobile banking, branch and overdraft services – to friends, relatives or other businesses. This information can be accessed here.
Directory of website links
A table of providers’ website links and API locations for the different current account brands (in alphabetical order) can be accessed here.
The benefits of this information
Publishing this information in this way will promote effective competition by incentivising firms to offer better services in ways that are transparent and noticeable.
The information being published reflects what customers have said they would find useful when carrying out their everyday banking. This will help people to choose a current account that gives them what they value. Comparison sites and the media will also be able to compare more easily the services provided by different current account brands.
Next steps
From November 2018, providers have undertaken to publish in a common form information highlighting the support they offer customers who have one of the four main characteristics of potential vulnerability outlined in the FCA’s Approach to Consumers 2018:
Resilience – low ability to withstand financial or emotional shocks.
Life Events – major life events such as bereavement or relationship breakdown.
Capability – low knowledge of financial matters or low confidence in managing money.
Health – conditions or illnesses that affect ability to carry out day to day tasks.
From 15 February 2019, we will also require providers to publish information quarterly on how long it takes them to open a current account, and how long it takes them to replace a debit card.

"Regulators warn public of pension scammer tactics as victims report losing an average of £91,000 in 2017",Press Releases,14/08/2018,14/08/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/regulators-warn-public-pension-scammer-tactics-victims-report-losing-average-91000-2017,"The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and The Pensions Regulator (TPR) launch joint TV advertising campaign to raise awareness of pension scams and the most common tactics used by fraudsters
New statistics show that pension scam victims lose an average of £91,000 each
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and The Pensions Regulator (TPR) have joined forces to urge the public to be on their guard when receiving unexpected offers about their pension and to check who they are dealing with. The two regulators have launched a new ScamSmart advertising campaign targeting pension holders aged 45-65, the group most at risk of pension scams. This comes as a new poll commissioned by the regulators reveals that almost a third (32%) of pension holders aged 45 to 65 would not know how to check whether they are speaking with a legitimate pensions adviser or provider.
Highly sophisticated scammers lure people into transferring their pensions into fraudulent schemes, stealing an average of £91,000 per victim. Victims of pension scams can lose their life savings, and be left facing retirement with limited income. 
The FCA and TPR are calling the public’s attention to the tactics used by pensions scammers. One of the most common tactics is to offer a ‘free pension review’. Research reveals that one in eight 45 to 65-year-olds surveyed (12%) said they would trust an offer of a ‘free pension review’ from someone claiming to be a pension advisor.
Cold calling is currently by far the most common method used to initiate pension fraud. Other scam tactics include: 
Unexpected contact about your pension via phone, post or email
Promises of guaranteed high returns and downplaying the risks
Offering unusual or overseas investments that aren’t regulated by the FCA e.g. overseas hotels, forestry, green energy schemes
Putting people under pressure to make a quick decision, for example with time-limited offers, and sending a courier round with paperwork to sign
Claiming to be able to unlock money from an individual’s pension (which is normally only possible from age 55)
It is believed that only a minority of pension scams are ever reported. The FCA and TPR are urging anyone who believes they may have been targeted to come forward.
Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, FCA, said: “The size of individual pension pots makes pensions savings an attractive target for fraudsters. That’s why we’re urging anyone who is thinking about transferring their pension to check who they are dealing with and only use firms authorised by the FCA. Pension scams can cause victims significant harm – both financially and mentally. If you are ever in doubt about a pension offer, visit the ScamSmart website.'
Nicola Parish, Executive Director, TPR, said: “£91,000 is a huge amount of money for someone approaching their retirement to suddenly have ripped from their savings. If someone cold calls you about your pension, it’s probably an attempt to steal your savings. Our message is clear – hang up and report it.'
Guy Opperman, Minister for Pensions and Financial Inclusion, said: “Pension scams are devastating for hardworking people and can rob them of the retirement they planned. I would urge savers to always exercise caution and seek independent guidance or advice before making important financial decisions. Anyone looking for free, impartial guidance on pensions can visit Pension Wise or The Pensions Advisory Service.'
Dimitrios Tsivrikos, consumer and business psychologist, said: “Scammers are intelligent, ambitious and deceiving. They mimic the sales patter used by salesmen, building trust, a rapport and a relationship to infiltrate our psyches and influence our behaviour. That’s why I want everyone to remember that if it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. So, put the phone down to unsolicited calls regarding your pension and stop a scammer from stealing your retirement.'
The FCA and TPR are urging the public to be ScamSmart with their pension and always check who they’re dealing with. The regulators recommend four simple steps to protect yourself from pension scams:
Reject unexpected pension offers whether made online, on social media or over the phone
Check who you’re dealing with before changing your pension arrangements – check the FCA Register or call the FCA contact centre on 0800 111 6768 to see if the firm you are dealing with is authorised by the FCA
Don’t be rushed or pressured into making any decision about your pension
Consider getting impartial information and advice
If you think you’ve been a victim of a pension scam, report it. Visit www.fca.org.uk/scamsmart to find out more.
The joint advertising campaign shows the contrast between the impact on the victims of pension scams and the lifestyles enjoyed at their expense by the criminals. Using TV, radio and social media adverts, it urges anyone who is contacted about their pension to visit ScamSmart before they transfer any funds, so that they don’t end up becoming the victim of a scammer.
FCA and TPR are part of Project Bloom a multi-agency taskforce which is working to combat pension scams. The taskforce includes the DWP, HM Treasury, the Serious Fraud Office, City of London Police, the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, The Pensions Advisory Service, and the National Crime Agency.
Notes to editors:
All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc. Total sample size was 1,018 adults aged 45-65 with a pension. Fieldwork was undertaken between 20-23 July 2018. The survey was carried out online.
The new ScamSmart pension scams advertising launches on 14 August 2018. The advertising will include TV, radio, online video and banner ads, and paid search.

The Treasury intends to lay regulations to ban pension cold calling in the autumn.
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority.
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well.

FCA collaborates on new consultation to explore the opportunities of a Global Financial Innovation Network,Press Releases,07/08/2018,07/08/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-collaborates-new-consultation-explore-opportunities-global-financial-innovation-network,"The network will seek to provide a more efficient way for innovative firms to interact with regulators, helping them navigate between countries as they look to scale new ideas. It will also create a new framework for co-operation between financial services regulators on innovation related topics, sharing different experiences and approaches.
The collaborative effort, involving regulators from around the world, is also today launching a consultation on the role the GFIN should play in delivering its objectives, including the tools it will use.
The consultation sets out the three main functions of the GFIN:
act as a network of regulators to collaborate and share experience of innovation in respective markets, including emerging technologies and business models;
provide a forum for joint policy work and discussions; and
provide firms with an environment in which to trial cross-border solutions. 
As part of the consultation, the group is seeking views on the mission statement for the GFIN, its proposed functions, and where it should prioritise activity. The group is also keen to hear from other interested regulators or related organisations who wish to get involved.
Christopher Woolard, FCA Executive Director of Strategy and Competition and Board member commented:
“The creation of the Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN) is an important next step for organisations like ours who are actively engaged in understanding and harnessing the benefits of innovation in financial services for consumers, while managing the potential harm.
“The establishment of the GFIN can help share the experiences and knowledge from across different markets, while also providing a platform for innovative firms wishing to scale their propositions via testing in multiple countries.'
Today’s announcement follows an initial consultation on the idea of a ‘global sandbox’ in February 2018 and provides an update on the next steps of the project. 50 responses were received to the earlier paper and were positive about the idea of regulators collaborating on this topic. Key themes to emerge in the feedback were:
Regulatory co-operation: Respondents were supportive of the idea of the initiative providing a setting for regulators to collaborate on common challenges or policy questions firms face in different jurisdictions.
Speed to market:  Respondents cited one of the main advantages for the global sandbox could be reducing the time it takes to bring ideas to new international markets.
Governance: Feedback highlighted the importance of the project being transparent and fair to those potential firms wishing to apply for cross-border testing.
Emerging technologies/business models: A wide range of topics and subject matters were highlighted in the feedback, particularly those with notable cross-border application. Among issues highlighted were artificial intelligence, distributed ledger technology, data protection, regulation of securities and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML).
The working group is asking for feedback on the consultation questions by 14 October 2018. Over the course of the next two months, the group will engage with interested parties across the different jurisdictions involved in the project. In the Autumn, the working group will assess feedback and agree on next steps.
Notes to editors:
Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN) Consultation
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this, it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.
The organisations involved in the GFIN at present are: Abu Dhabi Global Markets; Autorité des marchés financiers (Québec); Australian Securities & Investments Commission; Central Bank of Bahrain; United States Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection; Dubai Financial Services Authority; Financial Conduct Authority; Guernsey Financial Services Commission; Hong Kong Monetary Authority; Monetary Authority of Singapore; Ontario Securities Commission; and Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP).

Entering into any new regulated credit agreements and credit broking. 
This takes effect immediately. This means that the firm cannot now lawfully offer regulated credit agreements to finance the purchase of vacuum cleaners in the way that it did previously.
What customers should do
Customers who have existing contracts with the firm should consider getting legal advice from a solicitor, legal advice centre or Citizens Advice Bureau.  They may wish to take a copy of their paperwork and the First Supervisory Notice to get advice on their legal position.
You can get free and impartial advice from the Money Advice Service. (The Money Advice Service provides independent advice online, or you can call the Money Advice Line on 0800 138 7777).
Please contact the FCA 0800 111 6768 (freephone) or 0300 500 8082, if the firm attempts to sell you a vacuum cleaner on finance. 
Why the FCA has taken this action
The FCA found that the firm:
Sold and brokered regulated credit agreements during cold call visits to customers’ homes in breach of a requirement on its permissions which precluded it from doing so.
Failed to carry out adequate affordability checks on customers’ ability to repay credit. In at least two cases seen by the FCA, the firm entered into a consumer credit agreement despite being told by the customers that they could not afford the credit.
Misled the FCA.
Has close connections with a firm the consumer credit licence of which was revoked by the Office of Fair Trading.  
The firm has a right to appeal the FCA’s decision to the Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery Chamber).",6 - Financial Conduct Authority
FCA consults on rules and guidance to improve conduct and communications in payment services and e-money firms,Press Releases,01/08/2018,01/08/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-consults-rules-and-guidance-improve-conduct-and-communications-payment-services-and-e-money,"The Consultation Paper proposes to extend the application of the Principles for Businesses and certain specific rules about promotions and communications so that they cover wider categories of businesses that we regulate (including businesses authorised or registered under the Payment Services Regulations or the Electronic Money Regulations). This includes broader types of activities (including the provision of payment services and the issuing of electronic money where they are not connected to an activity regulated under the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA)).    
These proposals follow modifications to the FCA’s rule-making powers in 2017, which brought certain businesses authorised or registered under the Payment Services Regulations or the Electronic Money Regulations within their scope alongside businesses authorised under FSMA.  
The FCA has also proposed new guidance to help ensure that firms do not mislead consumers when they are advertising payment services that involve a currency conversion. This delivers on a commitment by the FCA made last year, to act on concerns about firms’ use of currency converter tools in relation to their currency transfer services. 
These measures should help customers to better understand that standards the FCA expects of firms in the market, and will make it easier for the FCA to intervene when it sees harm. The FCA’s disciplinary powers under FSMA would apply to breaches of the proposed new rules, including those relating to marketing and communications, and this would reinforce the effectiveness of the FCA’s enforcement approach across the markets for payment services and electronic money. 
Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA said:
“This is a measured intervention – for many it will simply reflect current good practice and ensure that they are subject to the fundamental obligations that we expect of regulated firms.
“For some, however, it should be a clear signal that through our rules, supervisory and enforcement action, we will not tolerate customers being misled or being treated unfairly.' 
The FCA is now seeking comments on the proposals set out in this Consultation paper, which closes on the 1 November 2018.

"Upper Tribunal upholds FCA decision to fine and ban Chief Executive of TailorMade Independent Limited, Alistair Burns",Press Releases,01/08/2018,01/08/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/upper-tribunal-upholds-fca-decision-fine-and-ban-chief-executive-tailormade-independent-limited-alistair-burns,"The Tribunal also directed the FCA to impose a fine on Mr Burns of £60,000 on the basis that he had breached the FCA’s Statement of Principle 7 by failing to ensure that TMI complied with its obligations under the regulatory regime.
Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:
'Mr Burns failed to ensure that TMI managed its conflicts of interest, benefiting financially from his role as shareholder and director at an unregulated introducer alongside his regulated role, to the detriment of his customers. Our action sends a strong message that failing to manage conflicts of interest fairly and disclose them clearly is completely unacceptable.'
Between January 2010 and January 2013, TMI provided advice to 1,661 customers who were considering transferring or switching their pension funds via self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs).
The Tribunal found that TMI’s customers were given wholly unsuitable advice to transfer pension benefits into a SIPP which was to be invested in either a single, or a very small number of, inherently risky overseas property investments.
The Tribunal also found that Mr Burns had a significant financial interest in the outcome of the unsuitable advice TMI was giving to customers. He co-owned and co-directed an unregulated introducer, also operating under the 'TailorMade' name, which referred clients to TMI. The introducer was paid significant amounts of commission by the provider of the alternative investment product concerned when TMI advised a customer to transfer their pension into a SIPP, and the customer subsequently invested in that alternative investment following the pension transfer. Typically, the customer was not informed either by TMI or the introducer of the payment of this commission or its amount.
There was therefore an obvious conflict of interest between Mr Burns and TMI’s customers which needed to be managed. Mr Burns did not identify, and TMI failed to manage, this conflict of interest.
The Tribunal also confirmed the FCA’s position that when a financial adviser gives advice to a customer who wishes to transfer out of their current pension arrangement to release funds to allow them to invest in an overseas property investment through a SIPP, then the financial adviser must consider not only the suitability of the SIPP itself but the suitability of the investments to be held in it.  
The Tribunal found that in these circumstances a financial adviser cannot give suitable advice if it advises on the SIPP alone because the SIPP and its underlying investments are part of an 'indivisible package of rights' which form a customer’s overall pension arrangements.
To date, compensation totalling over £55.6 million has been paid by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) in relation to claims upheld against TMI. This does not cover all the losses suffered by investors, which the FSCS assesses at more than £106.5 million.
The Tribunal’s decision was issued following a hearing which took place from 14 to 25 May 2018. The FCA issued its Decision Notice on 22 July 2016.
Notes to editors
The Upper Tribunal decision.
The Decision Notice for Alistair Burns and press release.
TMI was dissolved on 9 July 2016.
In July 2017, the FCA notified the Tribunal that it had decided to pursue a financial penalty on the basis of Mr Burns’ failings in relation to conflicts of interest only, in light of an issue which had arisen regarding the FCA’s power to fine Mr Burns for his failings in relation to TMI’s advice model.

In January 2013 the regulator issued an alert clarifying the obligations of financial advisers giving pensions transfer advice.
In April 2010, the Financial Services Act 2010 amended section 391 of FSMA giving the regulator the power to publish decision notices. This power became active in October 2010.
The regulator's approach to publishing decision notices was explained in Policy Statement 11/3 published in January 2011.

FCA statement on selling high-risk speculative investments to retail clients following ESMA’s action on CFD products,Statements,01/08/2018,01/08/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-statement-selling-high-risk-speculative-investments-retail-clients-following-esmas-action-cfd,"In June 2018, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) finalised temporary measures to restrict the sale, marketing and distribution of contracts for difference (CFDs) to retail clients. These measures apply across the EU from today.
We fully support ESMA’s measures, which are designed to protect retail investors.
In common with other regulators across Europe, we know that other products can create the same kinds of risks to consumers as CFDs, particularly where they expose the investor to significant leverage. ESMA’s recent Q&A on its product intervention also highlighted these risks. These substitute products could be sold under a variety of labels but share common features with CFDs and these features may cause large trading losses to retail clients.
We are concerned that firms may consider getting around ESMA’s measures by selling other similarly complex products to retail clients. ESMA’s Q&A makes clear that firms “should pay particular attention to the leverage made available to retail clients and consider whether the product is offered on terms that act in the best interests of the client' for products that have comparable features to CFDs, such as Turbo Certificates.
We will therefore work with ESMA and other European regulators to monitor and assess the sale of these alternative, speculative products to retail clients.

Firms must meet their obligations
ESMA’s intervention is focused on CFDs, but we remind firms of their existing obligations. In particular, if a firm is considering marketing, selling or distributing alternative products, it should pay attention to conduct of business requirements.

Statement on the further investigative steps in relation to RBS GRG,Press Releases,31/07/2018,31/07/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/statement-further-investigative-steps-relation-rbs-grg,"Read the full statement.
Commenting on the update Andrew Bailey, FCA Chief Executive said:
'Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched a comprehensive and forensic investigation to see if there was any action that could be taken against senior management or RBS. It is important to recognise that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited. Taking action was therefore always going to be difficult and challenging but after carefully considering all the evidence we have concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct do not apply and that an action in relation to senior management for lack of fitness and propriety would not have reasonable prospects of success.
'We have consulted with independent, external leading counsel who has confirmed that the FCA’s conclusions are correct and reasonable.
'I appreciate that many GRG customers will be frustrated by this decision but we have explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion.
'The fact that we can’t take action in no way condones the behaviour of RBS. We expect high standards from the firms we regulate and RBS fell well short in its treatment of GRG customers.
'We feel strongly that those companies that have suffered loss as a result of how they were treated whilst in GRG must be appropriately compensated. We are closely monitoring the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, an independent third party, to ensure that things are put right.
'Although commercial lending to SMEs is not regulated by the FCA, the Senior Managers Regime (introduced in 2016) means that we are now able to hold senior management of banks to account for the way that they treat their SME customers and the FCA will do that.'

FCA proposes changes to complaint handling rules to help victims of authorised push payment fraud,Press Releases,26/06/2018,26/06/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-proposes-changes-complaint-handling-rules-help-victims-authorised-push-payment-fraud,"UK Finance data on APP fraud show there were 43,875 cases of APP fraud and total losses of £236 million in 2017.
Where their own PSP is not at fault, victims of APP fraud cannot at present complain to the PSP receiving their payment. The FCA is consulting to require firms to handle these complaints in line with complaints handling rules in the FCA Handbook.
The FCA is also proposing to allow eligible complainants to refer these complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service if they are unhappy with the outcome reached by the receiving PSP, or if they have not received a response to the complaint at all.
The FCA also plans to consult, later in the year, on requiring PSPs to report data on the complaints about alleged APP fraud that they receive. This data can be used by the industry as an indicator of progress on APP fraud and to inform FCA supervisory work.
The FCA shares concerns with the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) and the industry that APP fraud is a growing problem. This consultation published today builds on the work of the FCA and PSR to better protect consumers from APP fraud. The FCA and PSR investigated APP fraud and found that PSPs could do more to identify fraudulent incoming payments and prevent accounts from being compromised by fraudsters.
Christopher Woolard, FCA Executive Director of Strategy and Competition, said:
“The FCA takes push payment fraud and the harm it causes to consumers very seriously. Our proposals build on our work in this area, and seek to reduce the harm experienced by victims of push payment fraud where they believe the bank who received the money did not do enough to prevent it. We are proposing to require payment service providers to handle complaints about this in line with our complaint handling rules, and to provide the victims with access to the Financial Ombudsman Service.'
Notes to editors
CP18/16: Authorised push payment fraud - extending the jurisdiction of the Financial Ombudsman Service
The PSR is the regulator for the payment systems used in APP fraud. Full information can be found on the PSR’s website.
The FCA is the regulator for PSPs and is responsible for the complaints handling rules.
In September 2016, Which? made a super-complaint to the PSR and the FCA, setting out concerns about the protection available to victims of APP fraud.
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).

FCA challenges industry to improve access to insurance for people with pre-existing medical conditions,Press Releases,25/06/2018,25/06/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-challenges-industry-improve-access-insurance-people-pre-existing-medical-conditions,"The FCA is concerned that consumers find it difficult to access the specialist travel insurance market. As a result, the FCA will work with key industry stakeholders to create a new service which will redirect customers to specialist providers.
Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA, said:
“People with pre-existing medical conditions feel poorly served by travel insurance. There are specialist services out there, but, often, people don’t know where to find them. We’ll work with industry to point people in the right direction and help dispel some of the myths and misunderstandings to ensure this market works better.
“This will also form part of our continuing our work on insurance pricing practices which are designed to lead to long-term positive changes across the market.'
In June 2017 the FCA issued its Call for Input to gather more evidence and decide how best to address concerns about people with pre-existing medical conditions obtaining affordable travel insurance. In the UK at least 15 million people are currently living with at least one long-term health condition. This number is predicted to rise to 18 million over the next decade.
The CfI prompted a high level of interest including responses from individual consumers, with many writing about their personal experiences. Most stakeholders felt that it could be difficult for consumers who have, or have had, pre-existing medical conditions to find affordable travel insurance.
A number of themes emerged from the responses including:
There is a lack of quality information on alternative options available to consumers after they had received a high quote or had been refused cover, which can cause consumers to assume that they are uninsurable. 
A general lack of understanding amongst consumers and firms around insurance terms and the risk factors that are considered by providers when calculating the premium.
The lack of transparency around pricing, the risk factors which drive quotes and how premiums are calculated which limits consumers’ awareness about their options and can mean that they have difficulties in finding competitive insurance that is appropriate for their medical condition.
The findings of the CfI will also be used to inform the FCA’s wider work on insurance pricing practices, as announced in the Business Plan for 2018/19.

FCA statement on EBA’s draft PSD2 Guidelines and Opinion for banks and others involved in open banking,Statements,22/06/2018,22/06/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/eba-draft-psd2-guidelines-opinion-banks-others-involved-open-banking,"We are supportive of the views contained in the EBA Opinion and encourage firms and API initiatives to consider these views.
If the final version of the Guidelines is the same as the published draft, and subject to our own consultation process, we would expect to comply with the Guidelines.
The RTS set out how third-party providers of account information and payment initiation services (TPPs) and account servicing payment service providers (ASPSPs) should interact and communicate securely to enable TPPs to provide their services to customers with the customer’s consent.
The draft Guidelines clarify how we should approach exempting ASPSPs from a requirement to build a contingency access mechanism. Firms can avoid having to build the contingency mechanism if we are satisfied that they meet the criteria for exemption in Article 33(6) of the RTS.
Next steps
We plan to consult on changes to our guidance and rules to reflect the RTS, Opinion and draft Guidelines during the summer. This consultation will set out the proposed process and level of information we require from firms to make our exemption assessment.
We expect to be able to make assessments from early 2019. As the RTS will apply from 14 September 2019, we will aim to respond to firms’ exemption requests promptly.
Before our consultation, ASPSPs and TPPs should be aware that:
We encourage ASPSPs to provide dedicated access to TPPs using secure application programming interfaces (APIs). Where standardised APIs, such as those developed by the Open Banking Implementation Entity, align with Payment Services Directive (PSD2) requirements, we encourage providers to use these as a basis for providing secure access to payment accounts.
Where ASPSPs do not opt to implement the dedicated interface, their interface must still meet various requirements under the RTS. For example, from 14 September 2019 all ASPSPs will need to comply with obligations set out in RTS Articles 30 (general obligations for access interfaces), 34 (certificates), 35 (security of communication session) and 36 (data exchanges) and wider RTS requirements.
All ASPSPs will also need to make available technical specifications, and provide support and a testing facility by 14 March 2019. However, we would encourage ASPSPs seeking exemption not to wait until this date to make these available. Stress testing will also need to be carried out by the ASPSP.
The RTS does not allow us to grant a partial exemption. We will provide opportunities for ASPSPs to engage with us before submission of the exemption request.  We also encourage timely requests for exemption as we will need time to make an exemption assessment.
ASPSPs and TPPs should also note that the Guidelines and Opinion set out:
That some ASPSPs will only be able to demonstrate that their interface is available to be widely used, rather than show it is widely in use.
That the use of redirection by an ASPSP is not automatically an obstacle; nor is there a requirement in PSD2 or the RTS for an ASPSP to provide more than one method of access.
That ASPSPs must avoid imposing unnecessary requirements (such as additional consent checks) when designing and implementing their dedicated interfaces.
That we would not be able to exempt ASPSPs whose implementation creates obstacles to the provision of account information and payment initiation services. This could include where an interface creates delays and friction in the customer journey.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Introduction: Nisha Arora, Director of Market Intelligence, Data and Analysis
Financial Lives of consumers across the UK – our new report
We are committed to serving the public interest by improving how financial markets function and how firms conduct their business. Financial products and services play a fundamental role in individuals’ lives. To make sure that consumers enjoy an appropriate level of protection, we need to understand consumers’ needs and experiences of financial services. 
This is why we set up the Financial Lives Survey, a large-scale survey of UK adults. It adds a substantial new source of evidence to our understanding of consumers in the retail financial markets we regulate: about the products they buy, their experiences of financial services providers, their financial situations and their attitudes towards managing their money.
Last October we published our initial report, ‘Understanding the financial lives of UK adults’, which analysed results primarily by age. 
Our latest report analyses the data geographically. This report provides a unique perspective of the survey results across the 4 nations of the UK, the 9 regions of England, and by rural and urban areas.
As a UK-wide regulator, we serve consumers wherever they live in the UK, and we want to understand how people in different areas experience and respond to financial services and how their experiences may differ.
There is a wealth of information in this report and the accompanying data set and I encourage industry and others to use it.
I hope you find this latest report interesting and that it stimulates further research and discussion.

Hot topics
Claims management consultation is open
On 5 June, we published our proposals outlining how we will regulate claims management companies (CMCs) when regulation passes to the FCA on 1 April 2019. Our aim is that CMCs are trusted providers of high quality, good value services that help customers pursue legitimate claims for redress.  
The proposals outlined in our consultation are integral to achieving that aim, and include:
requiring CMCs to provide to potential customers a short summary document setting out important information about the services provided 
requiring CMCs that buy ‘lead lists’ from third parties to carry out due diligence around how those leads were obtained, 
asking CMCs to record all calls with customers, and to keep the recordings for a minimum of 12 months 
requiring firms to hold capital linked to the type of business they undertake 
a new requirement to protect client money
Our consultation sets out our proposed approach to authorising both existing and new CMCs including how temporary permissions will operate.
There will be opportunities to provide feedback on our proposals including various events for CMCs.
The deadline for providing feedback on our proposals is 3 August 2018. You can read the Consultation Paper here.
Simplified access to the GABRIEL system
We have made improvements to the log-in and password reset process for the GABRIEL reporting system. 
From the 11 June 2018, you will be able to:
Use your registered email address as your username.
Register all types of email domain addresses. This means you (as well as all of your users) can use an email address that doesn’t just end with .com or .co.uk.
Reset your password by using our new self-service tool. You will no longer have to answer the security questions.
We hope you’ll find these changes beneficial and access to the system much easier and quicker.

Banks and Building Societies
Digital regulatory reporting
We are working with the Bank of England on 6 month pilots to build upon the Proof of Concept developed at our November TechSprint on digital regulatory reporting. The pilots will evaluate the feasibility of scaling the work from the TechSprint considering 2 use cases. One will focus on retail reporting and the other on wholesale reporting. Any financial services firm that wishes to participate in either of the pilots will need to help with resourcing. However, transparency is an integral part of the pilots and we welcome and encourage input from across the industry. All findings from the pilots will be published and the intended output will be open source. We will provide opportunities for firms to provide feedback on the direction of the pilots as they progress. For further information, including on how to participate in the pilots, please email [email protected].
The Bank of England is consulting on a new messaging standard for UK payments
Register here – the deadline for submissions is 18 July 2018.
The major UK payments systems (CHAPS, Faster Payments, Bacs) are moving to the global messaging standard for payments, known as ‘ISO 20022’. The coordinated adoption of a single standard across UK payment systems will bring many benefits for payments providers, and for the businesses and households they serve. The design of the standard is consistent with that of many other countries and is a significant step forward in harmonisation, both domestically, and for cross-border payments.

FCA response to Law Commission recommendations on pension funds and social investment
The Government has published a response to the Law Commission’s (LC) report on pension funds and social investment. We contributed to the document with our response to recommendations that we consider:
Rule changes to require Independent Governance Committees (IGCs) to report on their firm’s policies on how they evaluate long-term investment risks.
Guidance for contract-based pension providers on considering financial and non-financial factors when making investment decisions.
Guidance on the types of investments that can be made by unit-linked funds (our permitted links rules) to clarify that these are consistent with the inclusion of an element of social impact investing.
We have carefully considered the LC’s recommendations. We aim to consult on rule changes by the first quarter of 2019 requiring IGCs to report on their firm’s policies on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, including climate change; on members’ ethical concerns; and on stewardship. At the same time, we will also consult on introducing related guidance for providers of workplace personal pension schemes on considering financial and non-financial factors when making investment decisions. We are waiting until early 2019 so that we can consult on a single package of rule changes affecting IGC.

The first set of events will take place September to December 2018. This year, we have added events for non-bank payment services firms in addition to events for general insurance and mortgage firms.
Visit our Live & Local webpages for dates, locations and registration links.
2018/2019 fees and levies – register for online invoicing
We will be invoicing firms for their annual fees and levies from early July to mid September. Most firms are now registered for online invoicing. If you haven’t registered for online invoicing please email our fees team [email protected] before July.
Operational Resilience
The operational resilience of firms is a priority in the FCA’s 2018/19 Business Plan. Over the coming months, we will be increasing our supervisory focus on the highest impact firms and carrying out focused thematic work with ‘lower impact’ firms. We will also engage widely with the industry to:
explain why operational resilience matters to us
remind firms of our current requirements and expectations
generate debate about how together we may strengthen firm’s operational resilience, minimise disruption to the business services that firms provide, and minimise the harm caused by disruptive events 
We plan to publish a Discussion Paper, jointly with the Bank of England and the Prudential Regulation Authority, about these matters in July.
Data Bulletin – June 2018
We have published the latest issue of the Data Bulletin. The bulletin focuses on new analysis of the retail intermediary sector based on the data firms have submitted to us via the Retail Mediation Activities Return (RMAR). The RMAR, is submitted by approximately 12,000 intermediary firms that each year help millions of consumers to access key financial products –mortgages, insurance policies, and retail investment products. 
We have published data from the RMAR since 2016 and hope that you find them a useful source of insight into the retail intermediary sector. In response to feedback from users of the data, we have added some new analysis sections. This edition provides an update of revenue trends to 2017 and analysis of activities and information on advice and charges for the last full financial year. Our new analysis includes a focus on capital resource requirements and professional indemnity insurance (PII) premiums.
Cyber infographic
We have published a new infographic on the basics of network security. It is designed to help firms, particularly smaller businesses, to become more resilient to cyber attacks.
We want to help the UK remain a safe place to do business, and a key part of that is helping your organisations to become more cyber resilient. We published our first guide on cyber security last year, and our new infographic expands on the good practice points we raised there.
Find out more by visiting our cyber resilience webpage.
Launch of weekly News and Publications emails
We have launched our new News and Publications weekly emails service which is sent every Friday at 4pm. Firms, consumers and all stakeholders can now receive the latest news and publications published on our website for that week in a single email. Subscribe to these from either the News or Publications sections on our website.
EU withdrawal
All firms should be considering the impact of EU withdrawal on their activities and customers. This should be considered both in the event the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, and also the implications of a transitional period until December 2020, under which EU rules will continue to apply. 
As part of this, if your firm undertakes business in the EEA you should consider the legal basis on which this occurs. This includes whether your firm needs additional regulatory permissions in light of EU withdrawal and whether your customers need to be informed of any changes. You may also wish to discuss this with the relevant local regulator and/or seek legal advice, including foreign law advice.
We know that planning for EU withdrawal will be a major focus for many firms over the coming year and we will make every effort to keep you informed and updated. For regular updates, please see our EU withdrawal pages.

FCA reveals urban-rural differences in how consumers experience financial services,Press Releases,20/06/2018,20/06/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-reveals-urban-rural-differences-how-consumers-experience-financial-services,"Today’s report finds notable differences between urban and rural areas. In rural areas, where there is greater reliance on bank branches, a higher proportion of people have difficulty getting to a bank and tend not to be able to use online banking. However, people in rural areas are more likely to be satisfied with their overall financial circumstances. By contrast, people living in urban areas are less likely to be satisfied with their overall financial position, are more likely to use high-cost loans and on average have higher levels of unsecured debt.
Financial Lives is the FCA’s survey of nearly 13,000 adults and is the largest tracking survey in the UK specifically looking at consumers and their use of financial services. 
The report shows a number of differences in how people in different parts of the UK, including rural and urban areas, experience financial services, such as:
Difficulty getting to a bank – in rural areas, a higher than average proportion of adults (13%) aged 55 and over, or who are younger and have a long-term health condition, have difficulty getting to a bank. This compares to 9% in urban areas. On top of that, of UK adults who never use the internet, 70% (or 3.7 million people) live in rural areas and the take-up of mobile banking in rural areas (23%) is nearly half that in urban areas (45%).   
Use of high-cost loans and have more debt - there is a higher concentration of adults with high-cost loans in urban areas (7% or 2.4 million people) than in rural areas (5% or 0.6 million people). Adults’ average unsecured debt is £3,600 in urban areas, compared with £2,510 in rural locations. Those paying for credit are more likely to be in urban areas (49%) compared with rural areas (37%).
Over half (51%) of retired people in rural areas rely mainly on the State Pension – this is their main income compared to 37% in urban areas.
Satisfaction with overall financial circumstances: 27% of adults in rural areas are highly satisfied, compared with 20% of adults in urban areas. Satisfaction in London is particularly low with just 16% being highly satisfied with their finances, compared with the national average of 21%. 
Across England, the highest proportion of adults with characteristics of potential vulnerability are found in the North West (55%). This compares to 46% in the South West. Adults in London have the highest levels of over-indebtedness (17% compared to 15% across the UK) and those living in Yorkshire and the Humber are most likely to be ‘in difficulty’ (11% compared to the UK average of 8%).
Just over one in ten of the adult population (13%) have no savings but the report also shows there is a clear North-South divide with more people in the North having no savings. 17% of people in the North West and 16% in the North East have no savings compared to 9% in the South East and 10% in the South West.
Andrew Bailey, FCA Chief Executive, said: “This survey shows just how different the experience of financial services is for consumers across the country. That’s important for us, as we shape financial services policy. But it is also important for firms, as they decide how best to serve their customers.'
The FCA has released weighted data tables which provide details of the survey findings, so that local decision-makers and other organisations can use the information to consider what they can do to help support people who may be struggling financially. The FCA’s previous Financial Lives report told the financial story for six different age groups to show key themes at each life stage.

Notes to editors
Read the FCA’s June 2018 report on the financial lives of consumers across the UK. 
Read the Financial Lives 2017 Report, Understanding the financial lives of UK adults
Potential vulnerability refers to those adults who may suffer disproportionately if things go wrong because they have low financial resilience. It also covers those who may be less able to engage with their finances or with financial services. The reasons for this can vary from suffering a recent life event (such as redundancy, bereavement or divorce), low financial capability, or a health related problem that affects a person’s day to day activities a lot. Being defined as potentially vulnerable does not mean someone will necessarily suffer harm.
‘In difficulty’ refers to adults who are the least financially resilient, as they have already missed paying domestic bills or meeting credit commitments in at least three of the last six months.
Over-indebtedness is defined as considering a heavy burden keeping up with domestic bills and credit commitments, or missing any credit commitments and/ or any domestic bills in any three or more of the last six months. 
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

Our response to Law Commission recommendations on pension funds and social investment,News stories,18/06/2018,20/06/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/our-response-law-commission-recommendations-pension-funds-and-social-investment,"Read the joint response (PDF)
The Law Commission made several recommendations for us in relation to Independent Governance Committees (IGCs), which we have considered carefully.
We intend to consult on rule changes in the first quarter of 2019 requiring IGCs to report on their firm’s policies on:
evaluating environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations, including climate change
taking account of members’ ethical concerns
stewardship
At the same time, we will also consult on introducing related guidance for providers of workplace personal pension schemes on considering financial factors (such as ESG risks and climate change) and non-financial factors (such as responding to members’ ethical concerns) when making investment decisions.
We are currently undertaking work on retirement outcomes – including on potentially making IGCs responsible for ensuring that decumulation products provide value for money – and to explore whether competition is operating effectively in the interests of non-workplace pension customers.
Consulting in the first quarter of 2019 will allow us to consult on a single package of rule changes, including other possible extensions to the remit of IGCs.
Permitted links rules
Infrastructure investment provides opportunities for social impact but such investments are typically for the long-term and may not be readily realisable.
The Law Commission also proposed that we consider guidance on the types of investments that can be made by unit-linked funds (our permitted links rules) to clarify how pension schemes can manage some element of illiquid investment within their funds.
We are taking forward further work on our permitted links rules in light of our involvement in HM Treasury’s Patient Capital Pensions Investment Taskforce and continuing work following the Treasury’s Patient Capital Review. We will progress this work in the second half of 2018.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Has the industry improved ten years on?,Speeches,14/06/2018,15/06/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/has-industry-improved-ten-years,"Speaker: Mark Steward, Director of Enforcement and Market OversightLocation: Banking Litigation & Regulation Forum 2018, LondonDelivered on: 14 June 2018
Highlights:
Good enforcement requires robust, accurate and faithful processes for detecting misconduct in all its guises and acting quickly and effectively.
Outcomes to our investigations may involve the use of enforcement, supervision, or competition powers, or a combination of some or all.
We are seeking views on a number of questions about our approaches to Supervision and Enforcement. Please send us your comments by on 21 June 2018.
Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from delivered version.
Thank you for inviting me here this morning.
The financial crisis
I have been asked to make some observations ten years on from the start of the financial crisis. I am conscious that everyone’s experiences here are likely to be very different. My vantage point, in Hong Kong, was probably different from most of you in this room. I will resist parochial anecdote other than to relate one story.
The most dramatic consequence of the crisis in Hong Kong, following the failure of Lehman Bros, in September 2008, was the default of Lehman paper held by tens of thousands of retail investors who, in many cases, had invested their life savings in a complex credit-linked instrument known as a minibond. Many of these investors were what we called ‘golden-age’ customers, or retirees. We might today call them vulnerable customers.
The reaction, when these minibonds defaulted following the failure of Lehman Bros, was not only an economic and financial one, it was also a social one, given the large number of affected investors who had little or no idea their investments could be damaged by the failure of a US investment bank. The noise was explosive. The public anger and protest was directed not only at banks who had sold this paper in large volumes, but also at regulators and the financial system in general. Confidence and trust, as well as savings, were the first casualties.
The point of the story for today is to ask whether the public anger that erupted ten years ago has entirely dissipated which brings me to today’s main question of whether we are now in a better position.
Ultimately there was a good ending for these investors and their banks: that story can await another day. The point of the story for today is to ask whether the public anger that erupted ten years ago has entirely dissipated which brings me to today’s main question of whether we are now in a better position.
Our Mission and our Approach
Last year we published our Mission, which was directed at redefining how and why we prioritise, protect and intervene in financial markets. We said:
our Mission is to serve the public interest through the objectives given to us by Parliament in the legislation that we administer
we will focus on harm or potential harm to consumers, markets and firms as the springboard for regulatory intervention.
These are profoundly important statements that reflect and respond to the FCA’s collective experience of the financial crisis.
More recently we published a number of approach documents, which articulate the mission more specifically in the context of how we use the range of our powers and functions. This series includes our approach to Enforcement and Supervision. There is also an Approach to Authorisation, Consumers and Competition and we will shortly issue, for consultation, our Approach to Market Integrity.
The consultation periods in relation to the Approaches to Enforcement and Supervision close very soon (21 June 2018) and I urge you to read them and give us feedback if you haven’t already.
In the Approach to Enforcement, we set out for discussion some basic propositions:
undetected misconduct causes loss of confidence and trust in our markets as well as financial loss. This means we should prioritise detection of serious misconduct.
misconduct needs to be identified and dealt with quickly and fairly through legal processes
the overriding principle is our commitment to achieve fair and just outcomes.
we will use both deterrent and remedial powers to put things rights.
we want to encourage firms to account for and redress misconduct on a voluntary basis where it is reasonable for them to do so - by imposing lower sanctions where firms have done this.
The corollary is also true, in that firms that fail to redress harm arising from misconduct, in circumstances where they could and should have, we will impose more serious sanctions.
We will be transparent by using the formal processes in FSMA to explain our decision-making so our actions also educate others.
The prosaic fact means our ability to anticipate better, to detect and to manage what has gone wrong, especially our ability to detect suspected misconduct, as early as possible, needs to improve.
Underlying these propositions is the prosaic fact that the incidence of misconduct can be reduced, but not wholly eradicated by better conduct and regulation: things will continue to go wrong and will need enforcement (and supervision). The prosaic fact means our ability to anticipate better, to detect and to manage what has gone wrong, especially our ability to detect suspected misconduct, as early as possible, needs to improve.
The Approach to Enforcement suggests, perhaps provocatively, that good enforcement is not achieved by higher fines if we don’t have robust, accurate and faithful processes for detecting misconduct in all its guises and acting quickly and effectively. This is not an argument for lower fines at all but an argument in favour of better detection and effective investigation in tandem with robust sanctions that should be as tough as they need to be.
Again, I would argue these propositions are ones born of the collective experience of the financial crisis.
We published our Approach to Enforcement for consultation on the same day as the Approach to Supervision. This was deliberate as Supervision and Enforcement are not isolated approaches with different objectives. For example, the aim of early detection and quick and effective action is only achievable if supervision and enforcement activities can operate together and in tandem, in a new, dynamic combination. It is self-evident, in this new dynamic, that outcomes may involve either the use of enforcement or supervision powers or, for that matter competition remedies, or a combination of some or all, reflecting a strategic combination of formal sanctions, remedies and interventions.
In arguing in favour of multiple regulatory treatments working in combination, John Brathwaite distinguishes ‘passive’ and ‘dynamic’ deterrence, where the former “…means setting the sanction at levels where the expected consequences of compliance are better than those of noncompliance so that actors, especially rational ones like corporations, will comply whereas dynamic deterrence “…draws more heavily on strategic studies….The idea is that generals win wars not by having bigger armies sitting in their barracks…but by moving forward toward the enemy, even burning bridges behind their army to signal strongly they will never retreat.' (J. Braithwaite (2016) ‘In Search of Donald Campbell’ ‘Criminology & Public Policy’ 15(2), 417-437).
There is much to be said for the effect of a mixture of regulatory interventions working strategically together, including enforcement, rather than a series of siloed responses.
There is much to be said for the effect of a mixture of regulatory interventions working strategically together, including enforcement, rather than a series of siloed responses.
This suggests a more multi-faceted approach to regulation which again reflects the collective response of hard won experience over the last ten years.
I am conscious there are a great many other post-crisis initiatives, including the Senior Managers & Certification Regime. I do not want to minimise the importance of these and other changes, all of which are beneficial. At the same time, the Mission and the Enforcement and Supervision Approaches, the latter of which, as I mentioned earlier, are open for consultation for another week, mark a step forward in the ongoing task of rebuilding confidence and trust in our markets. For these reasons, I think we are in a much stronger position because of what we have learned.
I also posed the question, a little rhetorically, whether the noise of the crisis has entirely dissipated. The minibond investors in Hong Kong received redress for their lost savings through an enforcement resolution that also addressed the loss of confidence and trust. Those responsible for the sale of these toxic products were seen to act responsibly in what was viewed as a fair outcome all round. However, I still hear the noise. The memory is not painful at all: for me, it is a good and helpful reminder of what is really at stake.
I know there is a great deal to discuss this morning so I will close on this point.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

The FCA will be raising a number of issues uncovered as part of the investigation with the firm in its supervisory engagement.
The investigations into Prudential, Countrywide Assured, Old Mutual and Abbey Life are continuing and no decisions regarding these firms have been reached by the FCA at this stage. No inferences should be drawn from the closure of the Scottish Widows case concerning the continuing investigations. The FCA will update the market when decisions are made regarding the status of the remaining investigations.

FCA secures increased confiscation order against Benjamin Wilson,Press Releases,11/06/2018,11/06/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-secures-increased-confiscation-order-against-benjamin-wilson,"The amount of the increased confiscation order represents monies currently held in a Santander bank account in Mr Wilson’s name. The bulk of the balance in the account is as a result of a payment of £31,825.18 made by the John Lewis Partnership upon the death of Mr Wilson’s mother who worked for the Waitrose supermarket chain. He received the sum as one of three beneficiaries named by her.
In addition, the Learned Judge found that Mr Wilson’s assertion that he had rejected his inheritance from his late mother was a sham and that he is therefore entitled to a one third share of her estate on top of the payment from the John Lewis Partnership. The value of Mr Wilson’s share will be determined once the estate has been administered and the amount of the confiscation order will be further increased as a result. As at today’s date, his share is believed to be worth in the region of £145,000.
Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the Financial Conduct Authority said:
“Mr Wilson’s activities defrauded over 300 victims and today’s outcome sends a clear message that crime does not pay. The FCA will continue to take steps to ensure that assets are confiscated from those who benefit from their criminal conduct, including seeking increased confiscation orders, where appropriate.'
On 14 February 2014, Benjamin Wilson was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court to a total of seven years’ imprisonment for defrauding investors of over £21 million. His sentencing followed earlier guilty pleas to offences of fraud, forgery and operating a collective investment scheme without authorisation.
When Mr Wilson was sentenced, a confiscation order in the sum of £1 was made against him in accordance with the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (‘POCA’). The Court found that his total benefit from his criminal conduct amounted to £21.84 million. However, due to his bankruptcy and civil proceedings in the High Court brought by the FCA, it was accepted by all parties that he did not have assets available to him at that time to meet any confiscation order. As a result, a nominal confiscation order was made.
In late 2015, the FCA was informed of the death of Mr Wilson’s mother. Enquiries revealed that she had died without making a will and that Mr Wilson was likely to have an interest in her estate as a result. Further enquiries also revealed that he had received the payment from the John Lewis Partnership representing death benefits due to him from his late mother’s pension scheme.
Section 22 of POCA allows a prosecutor to invite the Court to reconsider the amount available to a defendant and to increase the value of the confiscation order made against him if it considers it just to do so. As with all confiscation orders, the assets available do not have to represent the proceeds of crime and they can have been acquired after the making of the original confiscation order.
The FCA obtained a restraint order against Mr Wilson on 26 November 2015 in order to preserve the value of assets in which he had an interest pending the outcome of the FCA’s investigation and the conclusion of the further confiscation proceedings that followed.
Notes to editors
Details of Mr Wilson’s original sentence.
The 'sentence in default' is the term of imprisonment to be imposed if a defendant does not satisfy his confiscation order. In the event that a sentence in default is served, a defendant is still required to satisfy the debt, as well as any interest that has accrued.
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

A helping hand for the invisible hand: the FCA’s approach to competition and innovation,Speeches,11/06/2018,11/06/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/helping-hand-invisible-hand-fcas-approach-competition-and-innovation,"Speaker: Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy and CompetitionLocation: Competition Policy 2018: The relationship between antitrust, innovation and investment, Chatham House, LondonDelivered on: 11 June 2018
Highlights:
The FCA’s approach to competition is driven by our objectives to make markets function well and promote effective competition in the interests of consumers. This last part – in the interests of consumers – is crucial, because not all competition is good competition.
We create the conditions that allow competition to work as well as it can through initiatives like Innovate.
Open Banking has the potential to solve some of the big problems we see in competition by increasing consumer engagement.
But new technologies also present challenges, for example in the massive collection of customer data.
Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version.
What the FCA’s role is, and what it isn’t
I’d like to start my remarks today with some basics on competition.
What it is.
And what it isn’t.
And then talk about what that means for us when we think about fintech.
The FCA’s competition objective is frequently misunderstood, possibly because we’re fairly unique amongst financial regulators in having one.
It isn’t a duty to dictate a particular market structure or mandate an outcome.
And it isn’t an explicit commitment to promote competitiveness.
There’s a big enough debate around this last point to sustain a whole other panel discussion. But in order that I stick to my time let me just say this.
Although competition and competitiveness are often linked – competition forces firms to operate more efficiently, thereby increasing productivity and engendering greater dynamism in the economy – the FCA has no international competitiveness remit. Nor, given past history, do we believe it is desirable for us to have one.
Of course, we think about the needs of the market, particularly as the UK exits the European Union (EU) and promoting free trade and open markets becomes all the more important.
But this is grounded in our overarching strategic objective to make markets function well.
And we have a specific operational objective to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers: a recommendation of the Independent Commission on Banking, led by Sir John Vickers and established in the wake of the crisis.
This competition objective is focused on improving the process of rivalry between firms, rather than improving the competitiveness of any one firm in particular.
And it is this process of rivalry that leads to better outcomes for consumers, by forcing firms to work harder in terms of the choice, cost and variety of products and services they offer.
And therein lies the crux – the outcome of that rivalry between firms has to be in the interests of consumers.
Not all competition is good competition. Sometimes it can lead to a race to the bottom, and an erosion of standards. Part of our role is to step in when we see this happening.
What we want to see is a marketplace where, ultimately, consumers drive outcomes – rewarding firms who offer them value, variety and choice and punishing those who don’t by taking their business elsewhere.
Competition policy is not always fashionable. Competition can often be about long-term goals, rather than quick fixes.
Indeed, in the wake of the financial crisis it was pretty remarkable in political terms to see the Parliamentary Commission showing such faith in competition.
For the most part, though, governments in the EU, Europe and globally, from Teddy Roosevelt’s antitrust battles with ‘robber barons’ in the early 20th century and onwards, have accepted the need for effective competition policy and enforcement.
That requires a varied toolkit. In the FCA’s case, that often means using multiple tools, such as the Competition Act or market studies, alongside consumer protection and enforcement, something that is often ignored.
We also have policy tools to help foster competition. A good example is regulators and legislators at both a European and national level developing Open Banking alongside the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2).
In and of themselves, the functionality and scope of these developments can be seen as limited.
But, I see them as a fundamental trigger for what comes next – to think more deeply about the shape of banking and payments in future and how they are evolving. The policy environment can help set conditions for creative tension.
It is for that reason that we, at the FCA, are undertaking a strategic review of the retail banking market. Not just to size it up now, but look at where it may develop, the possibility for new entrants and shifting consumer trends.
Tomorrow’s world, today
Sometimes the invisible hand of the market needs a helping hand.
Part of creative tension is to drive innovation.
Innovation boosts competition, sees firms serve new niches, streamline processes and shake up the status quo.
When all these things are happening, our aim – to make markets function well so that consumers get a fair deal – moves from ambition to actuality.
But the reality is that these things don’t always happen on their own.
Sometimes the invisible hand of the market needs a helping hand.
That is why, since 2014, we have actively and directly promoted innovation through FCA Innovate.
At the heart of Innovate is the understanding that regulation designed to fit different products at a different point in time can hinder the progress of new technologies created for the here and now.
That’s why we decided that we had to create the conditions that would allow competition to work as well as it could.
This includes initiatives like the Sandbox, which gives innovative firms the opportunity to test their propositions in a controlled environment with real consumers.
This helps firms of all sizes get new products and services to market, and faster.
90% of firms from our first round of applications have gone on to market, with many firms finding it easier to get funding as a result of participating in the sandbox.
The result? Better choice. Better variety. Better outcomes for consumers.
And it helps us as a regulator understand the real-world implications of new technologies. We’ve seen this inform our policy approach towards distributed ledger technology (DLT) for example.
We are bringing the knowledge we have gained to the joint task force we have with the Bank of England and Treasury on cryptoassets.
And we are increasingly applying new technologies to our day to day supervisory work.
The level playing field
Few would argue against the benefits of this. 
Utility should be the primary driver of innovation.
But it does bear repeating that what we’re looking for is not fintech for fintech’s sake.
Rather, we are looking for products that serve a genuine consumer need, that offer a solution to an underserved corner of the market or a new approach to a thorny issue.
Utility should be the primary driver of innovation.
This holds true whether the firm in question is a start-up from the Silicon Roundabout or a long-established presence on the high street.
And yet, there is a feeling in some quarters that expectations are different for the former than they are for the latter; that somehow we’re giving young firms a leg up at the expense of incumbents.
This is simply not the case.
The fact is that we are presiding over a playing field where we expect participants to compete on merit.
There are no favourites, and there are no free passes.
But that means that if your best effort at innovation is an archaic, embedded IT system, while others are operating at the cutting edge to develop customer-centric solutions, it’s just not realistic to think you’ll come out on top or that anyone else should wait while you catch-up.
Not forgetting that incumbents can often count on brand reach and capital base, which offers significant advantages over newer rivals.
Ultimately, the companies that do well will be those that identify a genuine consumer need and serve it efficiently and effectively.
The future of financial services
Some incumbents have suggested that until we see fintech firms develop true scale – becoming so called ‘unicorns’ – it won’t make a difference. 
I think this is fundamentally flawed – or perhaps wishful – thinking, for 3 reasons:
It ignores the impact that smaller rivals snipping at areas of high margin can have on incumbents – as we’ve seen, for example, in car insurance and other regulated markets like telecoms.
It assumes that the protagonists shaking things up are small players, whereas entry from established platforms can be at scale – take Amazon or JP Morgan for example.
And it overlooks the rivalry between incumbents themselves. For example when major high street banks move on Open Banking, others have to respond.
The potential of platforms
One fascinating question is how far could this go?
Could the technology that sits behind Open Banking solve one of the big problems we see in competition – lack of engagement, especially from information-poor or time-poor consumers?
As it stands, a banking app might look for the best deal on your savings and move your cash. Being granted basic permissions, it can sweep your accounts to ensure you maximise interest.
But why stop there? Why couldn’t it also look at your mobile phone bills or utilities and switch you to the best deal?
Japan’s Money Forward is doing just that today and has already notched up 6 million customers.
John Fingleton, former head of the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), recently wrote an article called 'From Open Banking, to Open Everything', asking whether the exact same thing could happen in the UK.
The savings in time and money for consumers if it did would be huge.
Personal data will be the currency of firms in the future.
The trouble is, switching in the future could be very difficult. We’ve seen the same challenges with bundles in telecoms and media – great to begin with but potentially hard to leave.
We all know that technology markets have long tended towards monopoly or oligopoly. That is often an international position, not just a domestic one.
A trend exacerbated by the massive collection of data, this century’s most precious commodity, is the focus of intense struggle to control it.
Personal data will be the currency of firms in the future, with services increasingly tailored to our circumstances and characteristics. Bring with it a multiplicity of ethical questions way beyond competition.
And where does that leave smaller or new market players who can’t gather data on the scale of its larger rivals? The potential for embedded advantage here is a real concern, creating the risk that the position of established players is consolidated and new firms can’t break in.
The question for regulators will be how to extract the best from markets, whilst avoiding these pitfalls. Given the nature of the market, the answers we reach will need to be increasingly international not just domestic.
That’s one of the reasons why we have proposed that we could build an international testing environment, a Global Sandbox, and why I’m also delighted to have been asked to chair the International Organisation of Securities Commissions’ (IOSCO) work on fintech.
Conclusion
Whatever the future holds, I believe the outcome regulation and competition have always sought to achieve – empowered consumers making informed choices in efficient and fair markets – will continue to hold true.
Achieving this in the future will require us regulators to play a different game – understanding innovation, using innovation in our own work and most of all harnessing the benefits of innovation for the good of consumers.

New premium listing category for sovereign-controlled companies,Press Releases,08/06/2018,08/06/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/new-premium-listing-category-sovereign-controlled-companies,"In July last year, the FCA consulted on proposals aimed at encouraging such companies to choose the higher standards of premium listing, rather than standard listing.The FCA thinks there is considerable benefit to investors if corporate issuers agree to meet these additional premium requirements.
In light of feedback received to the consultation, the FCA agrees with certain points made and is taking forward the proposals with refinements to ensure the regulatory requirements are suitably tailored to achieve the best outcomes for investors and issuers alike. The FCA is therefore including requirements in the category in the following areas.
Independent votes on independent directors. This requires the election of independent directors to be subject to separate approval by independent shareholders. As for all other Premium listed companies, where independent shareholders do not vote in favour of the election, the requirement for a 90-day cooling off period after which the election can proceed without the separate vote of independent shareholders will apply.
Disclosure obligations on related party transactions beyond Market Abuse Regime disclosures. In effect this would mean timely disclosures on transactions between the sovereign and the issuer.
Two remaining key modifications to the requirements for companies in this category in the final rules are:
The absence of an advance sponsor ‘fair and reasonable’ opinion and prior shareholder approval requirements for related party transactions with the sovereign before these transactions are completed.
For some sovereign controlled companies, the number of transactions makes this a disproportionately onerous requirement. The requirement for disclosure of the transaction on agreement will remain.

The exemption for the sovereign from the requirement to enter into a controlling shareholder agreement with the issuer.
Past experience has shown that these agreements can be impracticable for sovereigns and disclosures in the prospectus and the wider information available regarding the relationship between the sovereign and the company support investor understanding of the relationship.

As in the FCA’s original consultation, other features of the premium listing regime apply as usual.  These include the need to demonstrate that a company is carrying on an independent business, the requirement to disclose information regarding the issuer’s compliance with the Financial Reporting Council’s Corporate Governance Code, proportionate voting rights and adherence to the principles of pre-emption rights.
Andrew Bailey, FCA Chief Executive, said:
'These rules mean when a sovereign controlled company lists here, investors can benefit from the protections offered by a premium listing. This raises standards. This package recognises that the previous regime did not always work for these companies or their investors. These rules encourage more companies to adopt the UK’s high governance standards.'
The creation of a new category within the premium listing regime recognises that the relationship between a sovereign controlled company and the state that owns it is likely to be different from the relationship a company would have with a private controlling shareholder. In addition, more information is available on sovereign states than on any other type of controlling shareholder.
While there may be relatively few listed commercial companies with sovereign controlling shareholders, the listing regime should have appropriate ways of accommodating such companies, for example companies on the path to privatisation.
The new category will be effective 1 July 2018.

FCA fines and imposes a restriction on Canara Bank for anti-money laundering systems failings,Press Releases,06/06/2018,06/06/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-and-imposes-restriction-canara-bank-anti-money-laundering-systems-failings,"Financial services firms are required to maintain robust anti-money laundering (AML) systems and controls, since they are at risk from those seeking to launder the proceeds of crime or to finance terrorism.
Between 26 November 2012 and 29 January 2016, Canara failed to maintain adequate AML systems and failed to take sufficient steps to remedy identified weaknesses, despite having been notified of shortcomings in its AML systems and controls.
Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:
“Financial crime and money–laundering failures are areas of focussed priority for us. Canara was warned its money laundering controls were inadequate and so its failure to remediate them properly is at the more serious end of the range of sanctions.' 
The Final Notice highlights the importance of branches of overseas banks and their senior management having sufficient understanding of their regulatory responsibilities and ensuring those obligations are met with appropriate resources.
Specifically, the FCA found that Canara failed to maintain adequate systems and controls to manage the risk of money laundering. These failures were systemic and affected almost all levels of its business and governance structure including: (1) Senior Management; (2) Governance / Oversight; (3) three Lines of Defence; (4) Money laundering reporting function; and (5) AML systems and controls.
As a result, Canara breached Principle 3 (taking reasonable steps to organise its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems) of the FCA’s Principles for Businesses.
Canara agreed to resolve the case and qualified for a 30% discount.
The FCA acknowledges that senior management at Canara have fully co-operated and engaged with the FCA’s investigation and that the firm’s substantive AML deficiencies now have been rectified.
Notes to editors
The final notice for Canara.
When setting the level of financial penalty one aspect of the assessment is how serious the FCA considers the impact and nature of the breach. In this case the FCA assessed the misconduct as a level four out of five on our scale of seriousness.
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

FCA sets out plans for regulation of claims management companies,Press Releases,05/06/2018,05/06/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-sets-out-plans-regulation-claims-management-companies,"Following a review of CMC regulation commissioned in 2015, the Government announced that the FCA would take over regulation of CMCs. Regulation will extend to Scotland, where firms are currently unregulated. The FCA has today set out how it proposes to authorise and supervise firms and the steps it will take should CMCs breach FCA rules.
Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive of the FCA said:
“A well-functioning claims management sector can help to provide justice and redress to people who have suffered harm. But the market doesn’t always work as it should and poor conduct persists across the sector.
“We want CMCs to be trusted providers of high quality, good value services that can truly help consumers. A key element of our approach to regulation will be ensuring that consumers are both protected and treated fairly. The proposals we have outlined today are integral to achieving that aim.'
The FCA’s proposals will require CMCs to provide a potential customer with a short summary document containing important information such as an illustration of fees charged and an overview of the services the CMC will provide. This document will need to be provided before any contract is agreed.
CMCs will also need to highlight any free alternatives to using the CMC, such as ombudsmen schemes, in marketing material and pre-contract disclosures.
CMCs that buy so-called ‘lead lists’ from third parties will be required to carry out due diligence to ensure that the leads have been obtained legally and to keep records of this. The FCA is also proposing that CMCs will have to record and keep all calls with customers for at least 12 months.
Other requirements on firms will include a requirement for firms to hold capital linked to the type of business they undertake and further new requirements to protect any money firms hold on behalf of clients.
The FCA has also set out its approach to authorising both existing and new CMCs. Firms will need to notify their intention to register for Temporary Permission and pay the relevant fee to the FCA before 1 April 2019. Firms will then need to go through the FCA’s authorisation process. New firms will need to decide whether to begin their authorisation process with the Claims Management Regulator or wait and submit an application to the FCA after April 2019.
Notes to editors
CP18/15: Claims management
Review of CMC regulation
The Financial Guidance and Claims Act 2018 enables the transfer of regulation of CMCs to the FCA from the existing Claims Management Regulator, and extends regulation to Scotland. The Government recently consulted on the implementing legislation, which has not yet been approved by Parliament.

FCA publishes outcome of high-cost credit review,Press Releases,31/05/2018,31/05/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-publishes-outcome-high-cost-credit-review,"The changes the FCA are consulting on follow an in-depth review into the high-cost credit market and are expected to reduce the costs for consumers and give them greater control over their finances. These changes are wide-ranging and some specific proposals are being consulted on from today. In addition, the FCA will gather additional evidence and carry out further analysis before any formal decisions can be made on a number of other issues.
Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority said:
'High-cost credit is used by over three million consumers in the UK, some of who are the most vulnerable in society. Today we have proposed a significant package of reforms to ensure they are better protected including the possibility of a cap on rent-to-own lending.
'The proposals will benefit overdraft and high-cost credit users, rebalancing in the favour of the customer.
'Our immediate proposed changes will make overdraft costs more transparent and prevent people unintentionally dipping in to an overdraft in the first place. However, we believe more fundamental change is needed in the way banks charge customers for overdrafts. Given the size of the market our work here will be completed as part of our wider review into retail banking.'
Under legislation the FCA is required to formally consult on rules it proposes to introduce. Consultations must be open and transparent, and the FCA cannot prejudge the result. In order to consult, the FCA must have a sufficient evidence base on which to base its proposals and develop a cost-benefit analysis, which is why the FCA has launched this call for input. These checks and balances ensure any proposed measures are proportionate and necessary to protect consumers.
Overdrafts
The FCA believes that the way banks operate and charge for overdrafts needs fundamental reform. In 2016 firms made an estimated £2.3 billion in revenue from overdrafts; 30 per cent of this was from unarranged overdrafts. The majority of unarranged overdraft charges are paid by only 1.5% of customers, who pay around £450 per year in fees and charges.
The FCA is putting forward some immediate proposals today for overdrafts that it believes will save customers up to £140 million a year. Beyond that, the FCA will consider more radical options to ban fixed fees and end the distinctions around unarranged overdraft prices.
If appropriate, these options will be consulted on later this year to coincide with the wider Strategic Review into Retail Banking so that the FCA is able to take into account the part that overdrafts play in the current UK banking model.
The FCA is also consulting on mandatory rules to make it easier for customers to manage their accounts.
These include:
mobile alerts warning of potential overdraft charges
stopping the inclusion of overdrafts in the term 'available funds'
requiring online tools to make the cost of overdrafts clearer
introducing online tools to assess eligibility for overdrafts
making it clear overdrafts are credit or borrowing
Rent-to-own
As part of the review the FCA looked closely at the rent-to-own sector. Costs for the 400,000 customers can be high – sometimes exceptionally. The FCA has seen examples where people have paid over £1,500 for essentials like an electric cooker, which could be bought on the high street for less than £300.
The FCA has identified a need to intervene to protect financially vulnerable consumers in this market. The FCA believes the harm identified in this market is sufficient in principle to consider a cap on rent-to-own prices. It will now carry out the detailed assessment of the impact that a cap could have on the rent-on-own sector and how it might be structured. In the meantime the FCA is open to other options. The FCA will undertake this work over the next few months with the aim of introducing changes, if appropriate, in the rent-to-own sector by April 2019. In addition, the FCA is consulting on banning the sale of extended warranties at point of sale; this could save consumers up to £7.7 million per year.
Home-collected credit
Additionally, the FCA intends to strengthen protections for vulnerable users of high-cost credit in stores and at the door, by introducing new requirements to raise standards in disclosure and sales practices.
The FCA is announcing a package of reforms in the home-collected credit sector. These will raise standards in disclosure and sales practices preventing home-collected credit firms from offering new loans or refinancing during home visits without the customer specifically requesting this. The measures will also bring greater controls over the refinancing process, which may not work well for consumers. Changes in this area are estimated to save consumers up to over £34 million a year.
Catalogue credit and store cards
Catalogue credit and store card firms will be required to do more to help customers avoid persistent debt – in the same way as credit card providers have been made to do by the FCA. These changes are estimated to save consumers up to £27.5 million a year.
The FCA has already transformed some high-cost sectors, with firms making substantial improvements and paying more than £900 million in redress to customers across consumer credit. The series of measures announced today builds on this work.

FCA calls for more innovation to help consumers find the best mortgage deal,Press Releases,04/05/2018,04/05/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-calls-more-innovation-help-consumers-find-best-mortgage-deal,"The FCA has identified a number of ways in which the market could work better for some people. The FCA’s proposals are particularly aimed at helping customers find the best-priced suitable mortgage deal. The FCA also wants to help longstanding borrowers who are currently unable to switch to a better deal, often referred to as ‘mortgage prisoners’.
Christopher Woolard, Director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA, said:
“The mortgage market is one of the largest financial markets in the UK and there have been significant changes to the market since the financial crisis in order to ensure that we do not return to the poor practices of the past.
“For many the market is working well with high levels of consumer engagement. However, we believe that things could work better with more innovative tools to help consumers. There are also a number of long-standing borrowers that have kept up-to-date with their mortgage repayments but are unable to get a new mortgage deal; we want to explore ways that we, and the industry, can help them.'
The FCA's interim findings show:
high levels of choice and consumer engagement: over three quarters of consumers switched to a new mortgage deal within six months of moving onto a reversion rate; and
little evidence that current commercial arrangements between firms are leading to poor consumer outcomes; but
there is no easy way for a consumer to be confident, at an early stage, of the mortgage products for which they qualify – this is a significant impediment to shopping around;
a significant minority of customers (around 30%) fail to find the cheapest mortgage for them; and
a number of longstanding customers would benefit from switching away from a reversion rate but cannot, despite being up-to-date with payments; most took out a mortgage before the financial crisis.
The FCA has identified a range of potential ways to make the market work better for consumers. These include:
making it easier for consumers, at an early stage, to identify for which mortgage products they qualify, to assess and compare those products and, ultimately, to take out a mortgage;
removing barriers to innovation in the sale of mortgages, including those due to aspects of FCA advice rules and guidance;
making it easier for consumers to assess the strengths of different mortgage brokers. The FCA intends to work with the broker sector to develop metrics to help consumers compare brokers;
helping certain longstanding borrowers who cannot switch. The FCA intends to explore options to help these customers, for example an industry-wide agreement to approve applications for a new mortgage deal from existing customers whose most recent mortgage was taken out before the financial crisis and who are up-to-date with payments.
The FCA is consulting on its interim findings and proposed remedies. It intends to publish a final report around the end of the year and will consult on any specific changes required to its rules.
Notes to editors
Read the full report.
Market studies enable the FCA to take a holistic look at competition in a market, assessing how consumers and firms behave and interact.
The Mortgages Market Study looks at first-charge, residential mortgages.  Buy-to-let mortgages are not in scope.
The FCA has identified a relatively small proportion of borrowers who took out a mortgage pre-crisis, are on a reversion rate and up-to-date with repayments, and would benefit from switching to a new deal but cannot. These customers are sometimes referred to as ‘mortgage prisoners’.
Taking account of the way lenders tell us they treat existing customers, we have identified around 30,000 such customers with authorised mortgage lenders. We also believe there may be customers up-to-date with repayments on a reversion rate in mortgage books owned by non-regulated firms – we estimate around 120,000 may benefit from switching.
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).

High-cost credit: what next?,Speeches,02/05/2018,02/05/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/high-cost-credit-what-next,"Speaker: Andrew Bailey, Chief ExecutiveEvent: New City Agenda, Portcullis House, Westminster, LondonDelivered: 2 May 2018Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version
Highlights
Taking on responsibility for regulating consumer credit in 2014 has been one of the largest tasks the FCA has undertaken.
In 2017, we published the findings of a major survey on the financial lives of UK adults.
The FCA has already been active to seek to reform and to tackle harm that has built up.
It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak this morning. I want to start by thanking the organisers because the subject matter of high-cost credit is not only of great importance to us at the FCA, but also to the country as a whole. I will try to set out why we think it is an important subject, and in doing so set out the evidence as we see it, and use that to provide a roadmap for how we are approaching the material that we will issue at the end of this month, setting out steps that can be taken to tackle the problems we identify.
Taking on the responsibility for regulating consumer credit in 2014 has been one of the largest tasks the FCA has undertaken. It has added around 30,000 firms to our register, of which the high-cost sector is only a part. And we recognise that we have more to do to get a sector that supports consumers appropriately.
It is useful to start with a definition or two. We consider consumer credit products to include:
credit cards
overdrafts
retail finance
store cards
personal loans
motor finance
catalogue credit
hire-purchase/rent to own (excluding cars)
payday loans
short-term instalment loans
home collected loans
pawn broking
some peer-to-peer loans
logbook loans
The order I have just given is by scale of activity – credit cards are largest, logbook loans are least used. A sub-set of consumer credit activities are distinctly high cost.
Our current focus is on overdrafts, rent-to-own, home-collected credit and catalogue credit because of the particular risks to consumers that we have found in these areas. Bear in mind here that we have also decided to maintain the package of measures that make up the payday loan cap and conducted a market study on credit cards. And we have reviewed all consumer credit firms as part of our authorisation and supervision work, driving up standards across the industry and focusing particular scrutiny on firms that pose more risks to consumers, including those in high-cost sectors.
Our current focus is on overdrafts, rent-to-own, home-collected credit and catalogue credit because of the particular risks to consumers that we have found in these areas.
Last year, we published the findings of a major survey on the financial lives of UK adults. The headlines are as follows: 3.1 million UK adults (6%) have one or more high-cost loans or had one in the previous twelve months. Additionally 25% of all UK adults have been overdrawn in the last twelve months (that’s 17.9 million adults), of which 3.1 million used an unauthorised overdraft facility.
In our survey, people showing characteristics of potential vulnerability were twice as likely to have used high-cost credit as other UK adults.
These circumstances include low financial resilience, and as well as financial circumstances, life events such as job loss, bereavement, relationship breakdown, serious accident, and health related issues. In terms of age groups, potential vulnerability is higher among the younger and the older age groups. Younger single parents are three times as likely to be using high-cost credit as the UK average.
People who are more likely to use high-cost credit are: those between 25 to 34 and 35 to 44 age groups or with financially dependent children, single parents, and particularly those aged 18 to 34), the unemployed, those renting their home or people with a physical or mental health condition or illness that affects their day-to-day activities, and people with no savings or investments.
Looking at unsecured debt levels, the average level for all UK adults is £3,320 rising to £4,960 when Student Loan Company debt is included. Bear in mind that 62% of UK adults have no debt, which obviously affects the distribution around the average.
If we look at 18 to 24 year olds, they owe £1,460 on average, rising to £8,750 with Student Loan Company loans. For those with debt, including SLC loans, the average outstanding is £17,440. According to our survey, this group has the lowest level of financial resilience, is least confident in managing money and least knowledgeable about financial matters. At first glance, this can come across as something of a paradox as this group is almost certainly the most technology savvy. But tech and financial awareness do not necessarily go together.
Adults aged 25 to 34, have the highest level of over-indebtedness of any age group, with below average financial resilience, and the highest ownership of high-cost loans along with the next group up (35 to 44 years old). And 37% of all UK adults with a payday loan are in this age group. They are also the most likely group to have catalogue credit balances. Noteworthy too is that trust in the financial services industry is low in this age group, below that of the population as a whole. More people in this group disagree that financial firms are honest and transparent than any other age group (44% versus 34% of all UK adults).
Touching briefly on older groups, 35 to 44 year olds are the most likely of any age group to hold an unsecured consumer credit product (86% versus 78% of all UK adults). They are also the most likely to have been overdrawn in the last year, joint and most likely to have a high-cost loan, together with the 25 to 34 age group, and most likely to be revolving users of credit on a credit card. But their assessed financial resilience is higher: among the 45 to 54 year old group, 1.5 million are over-indebted (18%, versus 21% of 35 to 44 year olds). The tendency to have unsecured debt then drops off sharply among 55 to 64 year olds.
Understanding the financial lives of UK adults
The Financial Lives survey has given us an important set of insights, which we have married up with an enormous amount of data in our review of high-cost credit. We’ve looked at tens of millions of credit files, conducted randomised trials, surveyed thousands of people and run more than a hundred in-depth interviews and focus groups. I want now to give some salient facts on the high-cost credit sectors that are of most current interest to us, namely overdrafts, rent-to-own, home-collected credit and catalogue credit.
We’ve looked at tens of millions of credit files, conducted randomised trials, surveyed thousands of people and run more than a hundred in-depth interviews and focus groups.
Let me start with overdrafts. Data received from personal current account providers show that annual revenues from unarranged overdrafts, excluding unpaid item fees, were around 200% of the average amount outstanding in 2016, with a range of 100 to 440% across the firms we looked at. For arranged overdrafts, it is around 25%, with a range around 14 to 38% across the firms. We are looking at whether this difference can be justified. Unarranged overdraft fees and charges also appear to be highly concentrated: while around 20% of personal current accounts received charges for using an unarranged overdraft in 2016, over half of the charges were concentrated on just 2% of accounts.
Moving on to rent-to-own, during 2016, 200,000 people took out a rent-to-own product and 400,000 had outstanding rent-to-own debt at the end of 2016. For those who took out rent-to-own products in 2015 and 2016, the debt these consumers held on these products was over a third of the overall debt they held, and was significantly larger than debts they held on any other types of product. In 2016, our analysis suggests that rent-to-own customers had a median annual income of £16,100. Taking into account all of the debt held by these customers and recorded on credit reference files, the median amount of outstanding debt more than doubled from £2,000 in November 2014 to £4,300 in November 2016.
Our analysis indicates that home-collected credit customers have similar characteristics to rent-to-own customers, with a median annual income in 2016 of £15,500. The median amount of their total outstanding debt more than doubled from £1,200 in November 2014 to £2,800 in November 2016, with a quarter of this in home-collected credit. The home-collected credit market is larger than the rent-to-own market.
In 2016, 700,000 people took out a home-collected credit loan and 1.6 million people had outstanding debt on these products at the end of 2016, with a value of £1.1bn. Home-collected credit customers also appear to hold debt in home-collected credit products for a long time – many of the consumers who borrowed using home-collected credit at any point between 2012 and 2016 were still borrowing at the end of 2016.
Turning to catalogue credit, our analysis suggests that catalogue customers have slightly higher median annual income than consumers of home-collected credit and rent-to-own products: £17,700 in 2016.
The median amount of outstanding debt increased substantially from £300 in November 2014 to £1300 in November 2016, and debt held on catalogue credit is a smaller share of debt than credit card debts, unsecured personal loans and motor finance.
Catalogue credit borrowers differ from rent-to-own and home-collected credit. Consumers using catalogue credit are drawn from a wider socio-economic group and have on average higher credit scores than other high-cost credit products. However, we still have concerns about catalogue credit products regarding the high level of arrears.
Assessment of high-cost credit
We believe that there are some important basic principles which can help us set priorities. I would highlight four such principles. First, the cost of credit matters, and we did establish a measure for payday loans which linked the cost in interest and charges to the amount borrowed. That measure was of course based on the particular features of the payday loan market and we need to approach its relevance to other markets with care. This approach applies most easily to fixed-term loans. Second, for revolving credit, our focus has tended to be on whether customers are frequently in long-term persistent debt. And thirdly, we will consider the complexity of the product and sales practices, how difficult they are to understand and whether there are notable behavioural biases. Lastly, the proper assessment of affordability by lenders is important.
When thinking about the high-cost credit market, we also adopt two other broad principles to assess whether our regulation meets the public interest. First, credit can provide a socially valuable function for people. That said, as the payday cap has demonstrated, there are consumers for whom their economic welfare improves if they do not have access to credit. Second, and flowing from this, we have to take great care to consider what a market working well could look like for the majority of users and what the alternatives to high-cost credit could be, rather than simply clamping down on the immediate harm presenting itself without regard to intended consequences.
In saying this, I could sound as if I am too decisively rejecting the advice from Polonius in Hamlet to his son: ‘Neither a borrower nor a lender be: for loan oft loses both itself and friend’. To be accurate, Polonius was not so much advocating an end to credit as ‘don’t borrow from friends if you want them to stay that way’. Credit is not the right option for all consumers. There is a group of consumers who are on such low or uncertain incomes or whose personal circumstances mean that any lending is likely to be inappropriate or unaffordable. Parts of the social welfare system are designed to provide assistance to them.
Our view is that the provision of credit can nevertheless have a socially valuable function. High-cost credit users typically have low credit scores and many do not have savings but may need credit to make ends meet and avoid wider financial difficulties, for example, default on household bills or priority debts.
There is another group of consumers who are on low incomes and may be financially vulnerable but are nonetheless able to sustain low repayments for small sums. However, the personal circumstances of these consumers can mean they are especially susceptible to unexpected changes to their income or expenditure demands, for example dealing with changes to their living arrangements at short notice. Reflecting risk of default, borrowing for these consumers is particularly costly, potentially further decreasing their ability to meet their wider financial obligations and increasing risk of harm from the consequences of default. This is particularly the case where they need to borrow to obtain essential household goods, such as a fridge or washing machine.
Our view is that the provision of credit can nevertheless have a socially valuable function. High-cost credit users typically have low credit scores and many do not have savings but may need credit to make ends meet and avoid wider financial difficulties, for example, default on household bills or priority debts. They may also have very limited options for obtaining essential goods or for managing other larger purchases or bills. Consumers can benefit from using credit where repayments are sustainable and appropriate forbearance is shown if they have temporary repayment problems.
For many, but not all, users of high-cost credit, access to borrowing is an important feature which can allow sensible smoothing of income flows and the purchase of necessary durable goods. I do not take the view that credit should not be available to this part of the population.
There is a spectrum of credit products and pricing across the consumer credit sector aimed at different consumer circumstances and needs. High prices for lending to subprime customers are driven, to an extent, by the underlying economics of serving these customers. Making small loans over relatively short periods is inherently higher cost. It can also be costly to assess the risk of lending to customers with thin credit files.
Let me therefore draw an important conclusion from this part of the assessment of high-cost credit. For many, but not all, users of high-cost credit, access to borrowing is an important feature which can allow sensible smoothing of income flows and the purchase of necessary durable goods. I do not take the view that credit should not be available to this part of the population. Translating this into the responsibilities of the FCA, we have a responsibility to ensure there is a framework of rules that firms comply with which reduces the risk of consumer harm but allows the provision of credit where it is appropriate and affordable.
What are the alternatives and what should be done?
The payday loan cap has meant that the cost in fees and charges of a typical loan has moved from over £100 to around £60, which we estimate saves borrowers around £150m per year.
Many people benefit from having access to credit on affordable terms which nonetheless recognise the risk characteristics of the individual. The FCA has already been active to seek to reform and to tackle harm that has built up. The payday loan cap has meant that the cost in fees and charges of a typical loan has moved from over £100 to around £60, which we estimate saves borrowers around £150m per year. Across all consumer credit sectors around £900m of redress for consumers, in the form of write downs and payments, has been secured for around 1.6 million consumers.
Default rates on payday loans have fallen by about one third and firms’ revenue from late payments interest and charges is about half of what it was. We think the payday cap has been effective and is set at the right level. Debt charities have also validated to us, and I am grateful to the charities for arranging my visits to their centres around the country, that the cap has alleviated debt problems.
It makes no sense at all surely to create a well-developed social housing system, but leave tenants to provide essential furnishings and fittings at a cost which can be three or four times the ordinary retail price of these goods. This point has been illustrated very clearly to me on visits around the country.
I am aware that some stakeholders have called for us to introduce price capping in other areas of the high-cost credit world, and overdrafts. We are examining a range of potential approaches to address the harm we see to consumers using these products, and I expect to set out our views in the next month. As I have said, these will be tailored to the particular harms we have found in different markets – we will be consistent in applying the principles I have set out, but that does not imply that our solutions for different markets will be the same.
We are also exploring the development and scale of provision of alternatives to high-cost credit. The key issues here are: challenges in accessing sustainable capital for alternative credit providers; building a critical mass of support for such approaches, which remain today too much on the fringes; encouraging an appropriate risk appetite and cost recovery for lenders; and helping social landlords assist tenants to find alternative sources of credit to acquire essential goods; among other points.
If I could finish with one practical and important example. It makes no sense at all surely to create a well-developed social housing system, but leave tenants to provide essential furnishings and fittings at a cost which can be three or four times the ordinary retail price of these goods. This point has been illustrated very clearly to me on visits around the country. At the FCA we can do a lot to help consistent with our statutory objectives, but we cannot on our own arrange new sources of lending. We are willing however to do everything in our power to help here.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Asset management: A regulatory perspective,Speeches,26/04/2018,26/04/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/asset-management-regulatory-perspective,"Speaker: Andrew Bailey, Chief ExecutiveEvent: London Business School Annual Asset Management ConferenceDelivered: 26 April 2018Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version
Highlights
Andrew’s speech sets out some of the challenges for
the FCA, the asset management market
and regulatory developments in the sector
It's a great pleasure to have the the opportunity to be discussing such an important subject, not just in finance but in society at large. I will try to cover the waterfront of asset management from the perspective of a regulator. The FCA regulates the sector for both conduct and prudential purposes, and I am also a member of the Bank of England Financial Policy Committee which has the macro-prudential responsibility. That’s a pretty extensive waterfront.
Market-wide risks
One of the important structural shifts post the financial crisis has been away from intermediation of financial activity on bank balance sheets towards the non-bank sector and particularly asset management. The balance had gone too far the other way before the crisis, incentivised by weak capital and liquidity standards in bank regulation, and particularly to hold relatively illiquid assets in so-called trading books – a contradiction of terms if ever there was one.
The combination was toxic – relatively illiquid assets backing bank deposits, where the capital standard was inadequate to cover changes in the value of the assets. What could possibly go wrong? At the heart of this was a very simple issue – the most simple issues are often the most powerful – a bank deposit is a contract where the depositor expects the full return of the money plus interest. The bank acts as principal by taking the funds onto its balance sheet and has own funds or capital liabilities to buffer the losses and enable it to return depositors money in full. Ten years ago with the regulatory standards of the day it didn’t work out.
Since the crisis bank regulation has strengthened, as has risk management in firms, and there has been a progressive shift in the balance of financial intermediation towards non-banks. In terms of assets held, so-called other financial intermediaries (OFIs) – basically if you are not a bank, an insurance company, a pension fund or in the public sector, you are in this category – account for a 30% share, which is 5 percentage points more than in 2011. And, most of this growth is in the asset management part of the so-called OFIs.
A similar pattern can be seen in international capital flows. US dollar credit flows to emerging market economies have pretty much doubled in the last ten years, and most of that increase is accounted for by market intermediation rather than bank lending.
There are many welcome elements of this growth in the relative use of market-based finance. At the heart of it – back to my simple but powerful point on bank deposits – is that market finance involves an agent not a principal relationship, in which changes in asset values are not buffered by capital liabilities. In the area of liquidity and maturity transformation, the structure is also not the same, but as I will come on to, what governs behaviour in market-based finance is the expectations of investors, and they are harder to observe and not necessarily stable over time.
The post-crisis period has also been characterised by what we could call abundant global liquidity, which has been a deliberate product of central bank policy on quantitative easing. One of the intended effects of that policy is to cause investors to seek greater yield by increasing duration. It is no surprise therefore that we have seen curve flattening in risk free markets and a reduction in credit spreads in other markets. This was in the plan.
In principle, and I hope in practice too, asset management and other investment funds can act as a shock absorber with losses being distributed across the system, and with many investors being in for the long-term and able to ride out the shock.
It’s therefore important that as macro-prudential regulators, who naturally should focus on the tail of the distribution of possible outcomes, we focus on the risk that could arise from a snapback in yields. To be clear, I think that that so far markets have adjusted well to the start of a pretty gradual turn in monetary policy in some countries; so far so good. But if there were to be a snapback in yields in conditions where duration risk has increased, there are risks if investors, for instance, think that global liquidity conditions could tighten rapidly. In principle, and I hope in practice too, asset management and other investment funds can act as a shock absorber with losses being distributed across the system, and with many investors being in for the long-term and able to ride out the shock.
What could go wrong then? Let me come back to what is and is not known, about the expectations of investors on the liquidity – in this case market-based liquidity - of their investments. It is reasonable to assume that one of the influences on the expectations of investors in this respect will be the structure of the fund in which they invest, the terms and conditions. Let me highlight two areas here which receive our attention.
Open-ended funds
First, the structure of open-ended funds, and the degree to which they could be required by their terms to rebalance and reduce asset holdings in stressed conditions, and in doing so amplify market movement by acting as forced sellers in a falling market. This risk is most pronounced where the fund is holding illiquid assets and promising high frequency – even daily – redemption to investors.
We had this experience with open-ended property funds following the EU referendum nearly two years ago. Many funds chose to suspend redemptions, making use of a safety valve that is foreseen in agreements between asset managers and their investors. The safety valve was to suspend redemptions until conditions stabilised. In that case, the shock passed and the funds were able to stabilise and resume normal operations. Our supervisors reviewed these suspensions across the value chain. While suspensions generally operated without major disruption, there is room for improvement. Their more detailed findings are available on our website.
Is this structure appropriate? The question for me is not really about the appropriateness of open-ended funds per se, but rather offering daily redemption in illiquid assets which also cannot be valued daily. I would observe that funds with longer redemption periods did not experience the same issues in this most recent stress situation. There is a lesson here about maturity transformation in a market liquidity context. More broadly, we have to watch that these sorts of feedbacks do not amplify price moves in markets out of line with more fundamental drivers and in ways that could disturb financial stability.
Exchange traded funds
My second case is related and concerns exchange traded funds (ETFs) which have grown substantially since the crisis. The secondary market liquidity of ETF shares is dependent on market makers and authorised participants (so called APs).
We know relatively little – as we have not experienced a stress since this structure grew so rapidly – about the capacity and willingness of APs to execute their function in stressed conditions where they may be under pressure to tighten their own risk limits. The result could be unexpectedly large discounts for ETF investors selling their holdings relative to the estimated value of the underlying assets, and possibly a need to suspend fund dealings. As with open-ended funds, this could have the potential to amplify shocks to market conditions which are already under stress. We have no easy way of sizing this risk, but we cannot ignore its potential given the rapid growth of ETFs.
In setting out these potential risks, I don’t want to forget the message that the global financial system is more resilient than it was prior to the financial crisis. A lot has been achieved in the last ten years. But our job is to be watchful to the build-up of risks and vulnerabilities in the system, their potential consequences and to take action where appropriate. The structural shift in financial intermediation towards market-based finance means that the vulnerabilities and channels for stress to impact the financial system will be different. A common theme running through the two cases I have described, open ended funds and ETFs, lies in what level of continuous market liquidity conditions investors expect, and thus the liquidity transformation they accept. We must be careful to ensure that there is not a material misalignment between investor expectations and market conditions, and particularly how those expectations may adjust, or not, in stressed conditions. And, I would emphasise that this is not just a job for regulators. It is a job for firms too; indeed, first and foremost it is a job for firms to stress test their structures and responses.
Asset management in the UK: Current challenges
I want now to move on to asset management in the UK and the issues we face. 
Over £8 trillion of assets are managed in the UK, and that is nearly £1 trillion more than a year ago. The UK’s asset management industry is the largest in Europe and the second largest in the world. The majority of clients are UK-domiciled, but the industry manages around £2.6 trillion for overseas clients, of which European clients are the largest proportion at around £1.4 trillion and US clients next at £0.5 trillion. The UK accounts for around 35% of all European assets under management. Split by type of management, the proportion of passive management has gone over 25% of the total under management in the last two years. Six years ago it was just over 20%.
Looked at from the point of view of clients, we tend to divide them into two categories. Individual consumers account for around one fifth of assets under management. Institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies account for the remaining four fifths of assets under management.
Over £8 trillion of assets are managed in the UK, and that is nearly £1 trillion more than a year ago. The UK’s asset management industry is the largest in Europe and the second largest in the world.
As you will undoubtedly appreciate, there are strong forces of change affecting asset management in the UK, some of which are global in nature, others are UK specific. We set out these forces of change in our latest FCA sector views publication which covers the wide landscape of FCA responsibilities.
Among these forces, let me start with Brexit. As you will be well aware, there are a number of possible outcomes from the EU withdrawal negotiations. For asset managers the key issues are delegation of activity, passporting of funds and segregated account arrangements for EU clients. I start from the position that today we have arrangements in place which work well for the benefit of all clients, and there is every reason for all parties involved to seek to put in place arrangements post-Brexit which preserve the benefits.
As in any other global industry, asset management supply chains are international. A car produced in a factory in Sunderland will have been assembled using parts imported from several different countries. Just so in asset management. A global macro fund, for example, may be located in one jurisdiction, while the management of investments held by the fund may be delegated to a number of jurisdictions, where local portfolio managers are closest to their markets. Few would argue nowadays that all of the parts of an automobile should be sourced solely within the country where it is ultimately assembled. I do not believe it would be any more sensible to require a fund to be managed solely within its domicile. The truth is that delegation is a well-established global norm, underpinned by strong standards and regulatory cooperation. It is not dependent on EU membership. There is no reason to disrupt a system that clearly works effectively.
There is, of course, a more general point here which is important. Financial markets are by nature global not regional in form, and there is a very long history to this. Likewise, we tend naturally to think in terms of global regulatory approaches wherever possible. We are a very active participant in, and supporter of, the work of IOSCO. We work closely with other European Union authorities in this endeavour, and I am sure we will continue to do that post Brexit. Our common interests in effective markets and outcomes for consumers will not suddenly vanish. Moreover, global arrangements like delegation provide ready evidence that the basis exists for a successful model of mutual recognition of regulatory standards which supports continued open markets. As a public official, I take no position on the pros and cons of Brexit. But I do take a strong position that Brexit does not need to be an excuse to restrict trade in financial services, and that to do so would be a mistake for all sides.
Moving on, the next big issue on the landscape concerns changing demographic patterns and the interaction with macroeconomic conditions. I quite often say that if I could put Brexit to one side, hypothetically to be clear, this is the biggest issue that we face at the FCA. And that is because it pulls together a number of very big trends, namely an ageing population, persistent very low or negative long-term real interest rates, and increased costs of care in old age, to name three. Asset managers are very much in the forefront of these issues because increasingly you are providing the means of saving for old age, and the choices for consumers are becoming more complex at a time when – over quite a long period now – the responsibility for those choices has been increasingly transferred to consumers. This is an important reason why at the FCA we have a strong focus on the conduct issues that can arise.
To give a prime example of an issue that we face, the growing number of people reaching retirement could lead to a shift in the balance of assets under management from accumulation–orientated products to decumulation products, including a variety of income drawdown strategies, some of which are likely to be relatively complex.
Closely allied to these demographic trends is the decline of defined benefit pensions and the growth of defined contribution schemes and other retirement income products. This is leading to a range of changes in the sector. The big point that I would draw out is that there continues to be a major shift towards placing more responsibility for decision making onto individuals. We have seen that happening for some time in the accumulation phase of saving for retirement. Now, we are seeing the similar change in the decumulation phase as people exercise choices over when and how they draw pensions. Given the implications of an ageing population, low real interest rates and the cost of old age, it seems to me that greater choice makes sense in terms of individual circumstances and preferences. But it places a responsibility on industry to provide products and the regulator to establish conditions in which those choices can be made securely and confidently.
Developments in regulation
For the final part of my remarks, I want to move on to developments in regulation. This can sound like a laundry list, and a long one at that, something I am going to try to avoid by focusing on three areas: the market study that we have conducted; recent European legislation; and technology. As a list it also serves as a pretty good illustration of the breadth of the FCA’s interests and responsibilities.
The market study was conducted under the FCA’s powers as a competition regulator. These are quite unusual powers for a financial regulator by international standards, but I regard it as something where the UK has set a very good example, and we take competition very seriously. We have identified several drivers of weak competition in a number of areas of the asset management sector. Some investors are not well placed to find better value for themselves, and can be relatively insensitive to the price of asset management products and services. Such investors struggle to protect their own interests and through this to drive competitive pressure on asset managers to deliver good products and services at competitive prices. To help mitigate this, we have issued final rules on governance remedies focused on asset managers as agents of their underlying investors. The proposed changes strengthen the duty on asset managers to act in the best interests of investors.
We have issued final rules on requiring asset managers to pay any profits they may earn when dealing as principal in the units of dual-prices fund without putting their own capital at risk (so-called ‘risk-free box profits’) back into the fund. We have also revised guidance published on changes to make it easier for asset managers to move investors from more expensive share classes to cheaper but otherwise identical classes.
As part of an overall package, we have also published a consultation paper with proposals to improve clarity over what a fund is offering (what it aims to do, how it intends to do it, and how performance is shown) as we believe that a lack of clarity is another reason for weak competition. The proposals aim to help investors, and their advisers, make use of better information to choose the right funds. This incorporates the work of our fund objectives working group. The group has included a wide range of stakeholders including asset management firms and investor groups. We are grateful for the time and expert input of this group.
Taken together, our remedies seek to address both demand and supply side problems in the asset management market which, if addressed, should lead to greater competition and innovation in this market in the interests of the consumers it serves.
The market study also highlighted the importance of clear disclosure of what asset management services cost through the presentation of a ‘single charge’. MiFID II and the Packaged Retail and Insurance based Investment Products Regulation (PRIIPS) have recently introduced greater disclosure of all costs and charges, including transaction costs. Consumers should now see the full costs and charges, expressed as a single fee, for most transactions in investment products. This is a significant step forward, though we will be conducting some work to evaluate how effective these measures have proved in practice. In any case, how the new information is presented will be as important as the disclosure itself if it is to help consumers make more informed choices. To better understand this, we conducted behavioural testing. We have published the results of the testing. The findings show that different disclosure techniques yield meaningfully different outcomes for consumer engagement. Firms should consider the results when thinking about how their disclosures are working.
In response to other concerns highlighted by the market study, we are supporting an independent Institutional Disclosure Working Group (DWG). The group is seeking to agree a disclosure framework to support consistent disclosure of costs and charges to institutional investors.
The market study also highlighted issues of conflicts of interest, ineffective competition and a lack of transparency on fiduciary management performance and fees in the investment consulting market. These could result in: inappropriate purchase decisions and possibly too high prices being paid for fiduciary management services; and poor service levels and too high fees for investment consultancy services as a result of ineffective competition. We have referred investment consultants to the CMA, and now await the outcome of their investigation.
As I hope you can tell, this is a very important package of measures which is designed to reflect the importance of asset management to long-term savings in this country.
As I mentioned earlier, in EU regulations we saw a major change in the landscape at the start of this year with the introduction of MiFID II and PRIIPS.
MiFID II is probably the largest single change ever in European financial market regulation. Our initial priority, to be very clear because I know this attracts attention in some quarters, was to implement MiFID II in a way that did not stop the effective functioning of markets. I want to be very clear on that. It does not mean that we disregard rules, but it does recognise that implementing rules in a market that wasn’t functioning would be – at its kindest – getting the cart before the horse. Our supervisors have a programme of work to assess the state of compliance and to evaluate how effective the regulations have been in meeting their aims. In order to undertake that work properly, it is appropriate, as we generally do following major pieces of regulatory change, to allow the market time to evolve and to allow an adequate period of time to pass to make meaningful observations of trends and patterns.
PRIIPS, meanwhile, establishes standard disclosure obligations, including a requirement to disclose transaction costs for retail products under scope. It also introduced a requirement for firms to produce, publish and provide a standardised key information document (KID) for PRIIPS. This was so that investors can make better informed decisions by being able to compare key features, risks and rewards of PRIIPS. 
Some firms have told us they have concerns about this directly applicable EU regulation. In response, in January we published a statement clarifying some of our views on the KID. We will continue to engage with firms and their trade associations to consider how their concerns may be resolved so that investors get the full benefit of the Regulation. We will also continue to work with the European Supervisory Authorities, and contribute to the European Commission’s post-implementation review of the PRIIPS Regulation.
I want to be clear that I am concerned about PRIIPS, and I know I am not alone. It carries a risk that it is leading to literally accurate disclosure which is not providing useful context, and there is evidence that funds, for instance from the US, are withdrawing from Europe to avoid the burden. I have also heard concerns about performance projections. We all have to take this seriously.
And so, finally, technology. Technology advances are leading to various changes in the investment management sector. There have been significant developments in straight-through deal processing (STP) and distributed ledger technology (DLT). Asset managers continue to look for ways to increase efficiency in their front and back offices. Outsourcing investment administration processes to specialist providers plays an important part in this. The advent of DLT opens the potential for STP to become even more efficient. Potential benefits include more efficient management of counterparty risk, enhanced reconciliation and lower collateral requirements. As regulators, we will be looking at the ability of firms to oversee DLT, STP and other technology-related outsourcing arrangements effectively. There are also questions around accountability, if interruption to these services results in any losses for investors.
Another area of growth is the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI). Areas using AI include risk management, compliance, investment decisions, securities trading and monitoring, and client relationship management. Investment managers may well have to increase their technology spends to keep up with AI developments. Supervision of artificial intelligence remains a challenge and may also raise issues of accountability.
Growth of online distribution channels and potential channel consolidation could lead to fewer routes to market being available for asset managers. If online distribution is dominated by only a few online distributors their market power may change the value chain dynamics. This could in turn lead to a reduced range of investment products available to investors. Our platform market study, which will publish an interim report in summer 2018, will shed more light on this area.
Conclusion
This could come across as a pretty daunting list of issues. But, look at it another way, as a description it shows just how important asset management is, and the public policy issues that arise.
Asset management is inevitably affected by the big moving parts of our world today: the importance of retaining open markets for financial services; dealing with the challenges of an ageing population in a world of low real interest rates; technological innovation; the shift towards market-based finance following the financial crisis and its implications; and ensuring the industry provides the best service to consumers.
These are very important issues for the FCA.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Highlights
Blockchain technology has numerous useful applications but there are potential risks to consumers and competition  to be considered.
Cryptoassets are a well-known application of Blockchain which has demonstrated some risks, and may require further monitoring going forward.
Distributed Ledger Technology shows potential promise for improving the financial services market but these benefits need to be balanced against the risks to competition which may emerge.
Understanding more about Blockchain is crucial to ensuring we encourage the promise of the technology while remaining mindful of the potential pitfalls.
As you can imagine, blockchain is something that frequently comes up for us a financial markets regulator. And the panel session title ‘Promises and Perils’ sums it up neatly: the potential applications for blockchain technology are far-reaching; but there are risks.
As a financial regulator, my thoughts on blockchain fall roughly into 2 groups. The first group of thoughts is about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies – and those are slightly anxious thoughts. The second group is about other applications of distributed ledger technology in financial services – and those thoughts are more optimistic.
Evaluating cryptocurrencies
Let’s start with cryptocurrencies. Also known as cryptoassets – for reasons I’ll come onto in a minute.
Cryptocurrencies first emerged with Bitcoin, beginning in 2009. Since then we have witnessed a huge increase in the number and value of these products. There are now over 1,500 different coins and tokens, currently valued at around $325 billion. How much is $325 billion? Big, but not that big. Some of the world’s largest pension funds are valued at around $1 trillion, for example.
For thousands of years, currencies have been developed (and backed) by sovereign states – and we think of currencies primarily in that context. Not exclusively – I live in south London, where we have the ‘Brixton pound’. But the Brixton pound is not worth $325 billion - the cryptocurrency phenomenon is clearly something new. What does it mean for regulators?
Without getting too deep into the UK financial regulation system, it’s worth briefly touching on the FCA’s remit. The FCA exists to make financial markets work well, and has 3 objectives within that: consumer protection, market integrity and promoting competition. We also support the Bank of England when it comes to financial stability.
The UK Government determines what activities come within our remit. Currently, that remit does not include cryptocurrencies. That said, we do regulate derivative products based on these assets, and we also regulate initial coin offerings (I understand this is the case here in the Netherlands as well).
Faced with a thorny public policy question, it can be helpful to go back to basics. If you take any economic textbook definition of money, it will tell you it fulfils 3 core functions:
a unit of exchange, (ie to pay someone)
a store of value, which you can save
a unit of account, which can be used for bookkeeping
In the early days, the primary purpose for many cryptocurrencies was to be a means of payment. Bitcoin’s ‘developer’, Satoshi Nakamoto defined Bitcoin as a ‘peer-to-peer electronic cash system’. And indeed there are pubs across the UK where you can buy a pint of beer with Bitcoin.
More notoriously, one of the early uses for Bitcoin was for purchasing items on the dark web. Various platforms used Bitcoin because of its quasi-anonymous characteristics and faster settlement. These factors can also make cryptocurrencies appealing for money laundering or terrorist finance, which is obviously of concern to us a regulator. That is because such payments can bypass regulated financial institutions like banks, which play an important role in identifying financial crime. However, the fifth anti-money laundering directive will oblige cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers to comply with anti-money laundering requirements. 
More positively, we see firms using cryptocurrency for international money remittance, lowering the cost and time of sending money overseas. So there are legitimate and economically significant use cases.
Given our consumer protection objective, we do want to understand who is investing and how much, and we want to guard against people losing more than they can afford to.
All that said, most people now view Bitcoin and other such coins as an asset class rather than a means of payment – hence ‘cryptoassets’. Which is probably both cause and effect of swings in the value. In 2017, the price of Bitcoin appreciated from around 850 euro to over 14,000 euro (that’s 1600%). Why would I use Bitcoin to buy a pint of beer, when tomorrow it could be worth 20% more? Of course since then we have seen prices go the other way, down about 50% in the first quarter of 2018.
So do these price movements reflect rational expectations, or ‘animal spirits’? History offers us many examples of excessive market exuberance, and subsequent crashes – in assets ranging from financial to floral.
Speculation tends to be obvious in hindsight, but hard to call with precision at the time. Financial regulators are not generally in the business of judging when specific assets are overvalued, especially niche assets which (even at $325 billion) do not appear to pose a systemic risk. However, given our consumer protection objective, we do want to understand who is investing and how much, and we want to guard against people losing more than they can afford to. We have issued investor warnings in relation to initial coin offerings, for example. 
There’s an eye-catching statistic about Bitcoin holdings from a Canadian study. While only 7% of Ontarians owned Bitcoin in November 2017, the proportion was nearly 30% for men aged between 18 and 34. This is striking, particularly as this age group tends to hold fewer assets in other classes (such as stocks or bonds) so may be more rather than less financially exposed to cryptoasset volatility than other demographic groups.
There was also some eye-catching research by analysts at Barclays, who used techniques for infectious disease to model the spread of ‘Bitcoin fever’. The idea being that as people hear about friends or colleagues making money they are ‘infected’ and want to get involved, but once they hear of significant losses or lose money themselves, they become ‘immune’. According to Barclays, this modelling suggests Bitcoin fever may have reached its peak. Though perhaps like any good virus, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will evolve to ensure they remain appealing even to those who were once immune.
So let me turn to the final textbook use for money – as a unit of account, for bookkeeping. And this is where my thoughts begin to shift from peril to promise, away from cryptoassets to other uses of blockchain or digital ledger technology.
But before I do that, let me wrap up this first group. To summarise, there has been a shift from cryptocurrencies as a medium for exchange to being seen primarily as an asset class. This has a range of public policy implications. The UK Government recently announced the creation of a cryptocurrency taskforce, which FCA is part of, to assess whether further regulatory action is required and to monitor international developments.
Other applications for distributed ledger technology
In our recent discussion paper on distributed ledger technology (DLT) we defined it as a set of technological solutions that enables a single, sequenced, standardised and cryptographically secured record of activity to be safely distributed to, and acted on, by different participants. This rather lengthy definition reflects the view that DLT has a huge range of applications involving records, including records of contracts, transactions, asset holdings and proof of identity.
Already through our sandbox we are starting to see some of the exciting applications of DLT to solve problems or inefficiencies in the existing system. Many of you may have heard of the FCA’s sandbox, but those of you who are less familiar with in, let me give you a brief overview. The sandbox is a ‘safe space’ where businesses can test innovative products, services, business models and delivery mechanisms in the real market, with real consumers.
Of the 60 firms that have participated in the sandbox, around one third have used a cryptoasset or DLT. There are 3 broad themes that these firms have sought to address with this technology: improving operational resilience, using distributed digital transaction records to improve transparency, and cost and time savings from removing the need for intermediaries. Many of these use ‘smart contracts’, which automate payments or the transfer of assets as negotiated conditions are met (for example a payment could be sent to a supplier as soon as the shipment is delivered).
As a competition economist, we can identify two basic forms of innovation here that can help improve competition in a market. The first is where something familiar is done more efficiently. Let me give you an example from a firm in our sandbox. This firm used cryptoassets to settle short-term debt instruments, removing the need for registrars and nominees while meeting regulatory and legal requirements. Of course these tests are still in very early days and it remains to be seen whether these benefits hold up in a commercial setting but the initial findings are very positive. Another example is the use case in international money remittance, which I mentioned earlier.
I am optimistic about the promise for these developments to improve financial services markets. However, I am not so naïve as to think that there are not perils here as well.
The second type of innovation is more radical, where new technology revolutionises a market and opens up a whole new world of possibilities. In this area we can see new offerings such as decentralised peer-to-peer exchanges that may challenge the way financial markets currently function and the way we regulate them. For example, the development of automated trading process with limited fees will change the nature of the markets we regulate. These applications are still in their infancy but watch this space.
While there is much about DLT applications that is new and exciting, some of the competition questions DLT raises are familiar from other contexts. The distinction between public and private networks has parallels with open source versus proprietary software – and there are comparable debates about the advantages of making technology freely available (including to new entrants, which lowers barriers to entry) versus the prospect of private gains as a spur to investment and innovation.
In our discussion paper we outline the difference between permissioned and permissionless networks. In brief, permissioned networks have a gatekeeper who can control access, while permissionless networks are open to the public. If such networks developed to become essential infrastructure (for example in clearing and settlement) then there could be competition concerns around access to these networks if they were closed or permissioned.
We will need to understand this technology, its strengths and its vulnerabilities, and its implications for competition, much better before we are comfortable to entrust it with significant swathes of our financial infrastructure.
Another familiar risk of new technology-driven developments is that an early mover (interestingly, not necessarily first mover) can become dominant. This is not the session for an extended discussion of the relationship between ‘Big Tech’ and competition law, but in future we may see similar issues around dominance arise in connection with blockchain.
As I say, I am optimistic about the promise for these developments to improve financial services markets. However, I am not so naïve as to think that there are not perils here as well. We will need to understand this technology, its strengths and its vulnerabilities, and its implications for competition, much better before we are comfortable to entrust it with significant swathes of our financial infrastructure.
We need to ask ourselves as regulators what we should do so that we are not inhibiting the benefits, nor overlooking the risks.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Highlights
Now is the time for the UK and EU authorities to come together and work on the solutions to reduce the risks to financial stability that Brexit could pose. 
At the FCA we want to work closely with ESMA and national EU regulators to continue to enhance the stability and effectiveness of global markets. 
This has global implications, not just for the UK and EU, so it is important that we get this right.
I want to take this opportunity to talk about Brexit, where things stand from a financial services perspective. In doing so, I will focus on what it means to have open markets, and how we can preserve them for the benefit of all.
It is useful to divide the subject into 2 parts: the prospects and reasons for a transition or implementation period; and what the steady-state future world could look like. I will follow that approach today.
Before I do, I will make one point: we – that’s the UK and the European Union (EU27) - will not be able to achieve a successful outcome during both transition and steady-state without working together. Now is the time for the UK and EU authorities to come together and work on the solutions to reduce the risks to financial stability that Brexit could pose. At the FCA we want to work closely with European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and national EU regulators to continue to enhance the stability and effectiveness of global markets. This has global implications, not just for the UK and EU, so it is important that we get this right.
Transition or implementation period
To reiterate, regulators and authorities in the UK and the EU share common objectives to preserve financial stability, and we have a common obligation to do everything we can and work together to do that.
I welcome the agreement at the European Council on 23 March 2018 that there should be a transition or implementation period. UK withdrawal from the EU without such an agreement would create risks for both the UK and the EU27 of a so called cliff edge - which we should all want to avoid. The UK Government, supported by regulators, has taken a strong and very welcome stand on the need for a transition or implementation period, and I am encouraged by the acceptance of this point on both sides. This matters in financial services because the risks around contract continuity, data sharing, and broader market disruption could jeopardise financial stability, the preservation of which is a shared objective of both sides. If you want to know more about these risks, there is a useful description in the statement of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee following its most recent meeting in March.
There are 2 reasons in my view why we need a transition or implementation period. First, we need more time to mitigate these cliff edge risks – call that the transition reason. Second, it makes far more sense for firms and authorities to put into effect their plans only once they know what the steady agreement looks like – call that the implementation reason.
The cliff edge risks are symmetric in that they are present in both the UK and the EU. To reiterate, regulators and authorities in the UK and the EU share common objectives to preserve financial stability, and we have a common obligation to do everything we can and work together to do that. Financial stability is far too important to engage in a standoff.
I do recognise that the overall transition or implementation package is viewed as indivisible and that there remain issues to be agreed on it which are outside the area of financial services. But that does not stop authorities both here and in the EU working together to mitigate the cliff edge risks, even if we do not yet have a final agreement on what these arrangements will be.
The best thing we can all do now is to engage openly and speedily together to work on solving these issues and thus to preserve financial stability and protect consumers and users of financial markets. By doing this, we can create confidence that we will put into effect as smooth a transition as possible. We are ready to get to work on this. And, I would echo the words of Vice President Dombrovskis, namely that the ‘most important common objective in relation to Brexit must be to preserve financial stability’.
But for the moment we cannot assume that such arrangements will be in place and so the UK authorities have also set out plans for unilateral action in the UK to minimise cliff edge risks, providing continuity for firms doing business in the UK and confidence for their customers. The Government has committed to legislating for a temporary permissions regime. I welcome this, something that has been a priority for the FCA for some time as we believe that this provides certainty for firms which passport into the UK from the EU.
Alongside this, we are working to ensure a functional regulatory framework on day one of Brexit and as much continuity as possible in any scenario. Crucial to this is the very large amount of work we are undertaking on the EU withdrawal legislation.
But – and it is a big ‘but’ – while it is necessary to have unilateral actions in place for the UK, this is nonetheless a distinctly second best solution to the UK and EU authorities working together to deal with the risks. Let’s get on with it please.
The steady-state
On day one of Brexit the UK and the EU will have deeply integrated financial markets with aligned regulatory rules. That is a benefit to both sides. Moreover, the benefits of open markets are worth preserving. And we can do it.
Dealing with the transition will allow us collectively to focus on the steady-state future. The central guiding principle here must surely be that both the UK and the EU have a long history of promoting free trade and open markets. Open markets run deep in the history of the City of London - in fact as deep as you can get. The third Mayor of London, Serlo le Mercer, was a signatory of the Magna Carta in 1215 which stated that:-
‘All merchants are to be safe and secure in leaving and entering England, and in staying and travelling in England ……… to buy and sell free from all maletotes [unjust taxes] by the ancient and rightful customs’.
His successor, William Hardell was responsible for enforcing it, the predecessor of the FCA’s enforcement function.
On day one of Brexit the UK and the EU will have deeply integrated financial markets with aligned regulatory rules. That is a benefit to both sides. Moreover, the benefits of open markets are worth preserving. And we can do it. We can together build an approach that supports mutual recognition of each other’s standards to support cross-border business. To reiterate the point I made on transition, this is the best way to maintain financial stability.
Unfortunately, I have heard the argument made that the best way to preserve financial stability would be to become less open, to limit cross border flows of business, to restrict domestic parties from having access to overseas markets, and thus to ensure that activity takes place in the home jurisdiction. Let me reiterate, to do this means restricting the activity of parties in the EU. I say this because I have no doubt that the City of London will remain open to business, so the question is whether EU parties will be allowed to do business here, not whether we will allow it.
In my view, closing access to financial markets which are global not regional will undermine not enhance financial stability. It will reduce the potential for financial markets to support growth and trade, impair innovation and limit the ability to manage risk, and thus make the overall financial system more fragile.
Moreover, closing off access to markets by not recognising on a robust basis other jurisdictions amounts to an own goal from the perspective of choice and competition.
This has been recognised in a draft report from the European Parliament by Brian Hayes MEP, which notes that increased regulatory and supervisory cooperation between the EU and third countries has improved global consistency and made the EU more resilient to financial shocks. The report also notes that unlike equivalence, international agreements can provide mutual access between the EU and third countries which can better advance international cooperation.
In my view closing access to financial markets which are global not regional will undermine not enhance financial stability
Yes. I agree. Equivalence decisions and even better mutual recognition, increase choice and competition in home markets. They are good for users. The EU has already made over 200, and continues to make equivalence decisions which demonstrate this.
For example, equivalence decisions in the derivatives and trading space have allowed European banks to service clients across the world and EU investors to access pools of liquidity anywhere in the world.
UK markets are highly open and have remained so notwithstanding the experiences of the crisis. It would have been tempting to retreat from such openness following the crisis, but it would have been the wrong thing to do. In the UK we already have a policy for branches from non-EU countries in the UK which allows them to establish under certain sensible criteria. One of the less well known features of the UK regime is the Overseas Person Exclusion which allows overseas firms to provide services to UK based clients on a range of wholesale business without the need to set up a branch. We think approaches like this are a sensible and proportionate way to support stable global financial markets. It is underpinned by close supervisory cooperation which we have been strong advocates for and practitioners of.
I agree with Brian Hayes MEP that the current EU equivalence regime doesn’t best suit any of the parties. Mutual recognition, as he suggests, would be the better way to establish the steady-state between the UK and the EU in future.
How could mutual recognition work?  We can start by recognising that our regulatory frameworks are equivalent on day one of Brexit. This will be delivered, no doubt about that.
Both the UK and the EU will retain autonomy in rule making, but we should put in place cooperation and coordination structures that work to keep them materially consistent. For instance, at the FCA we want to work closely with ESMA and national EU regulators to promote common standards in international fora in order to enhance the stability and effectiveness of global markets. Our supervisory cooperation should be commensurate with the integration of our markets.
We should always base our rules on prevailing international standards. Continued alignment with such standards should be a clear intended outcome of any responsible financial centre, and where rules implement international standards, there should be a strong presumption of equivalence.
On this basis, mutual recognition seems to be to be eminently achievable.
But international standards are not always sufficiently detailed, and in some cases jurisdictions may wish to go further, and expect that firms operating in their market do likewise. As our rules evolve, we should regularly assess the differences on the basis of the outcomes they deliver. It should be possible to develop a set of principles by which we assess outcomes based equivalence, and that these work across the financial services landscape. It should give both sides comfort about risks, critically in terms of risks to our goals of financial stability, market integrity, consumer protection and competition. And, it should not promote regulatory arbitrage.
On this basis, mutual recognition seems to be to be eminently achievable. And, to be clear, this is not cherry picking, because that phrase gets used rather loosely at times. It is in fact the opposite.
Conclusion
I am encouraged that there are now fewer comments to the effect that financial services cannot feature in the steady-state agreement between the UK and the EU. They can and they should because the benefits of open markets will be realised by both sides. And, it is the best way to ensure financial stability, the integrity of markets, the protection of consumers, and competition and choice. These are the key public interest objectives for all of us, here and in the EU27. Meanwhile, we have to work together now to mitigate the immediate cliff edge risks. I’ll say again, now is the time for the UK and EU authorities to come together and work on the solutions to reduce the risks to financial stability that Brexit could pose.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority
"FCA warns public of increased threat of loan scams, as borrowers lose over £3.5 million a year",Press Releases,24/04/2018,31/05/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-warns-public-increased-threat-loan-scams,"The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is today urging the public to be alert to the growing threat of loan fee scams targeting borrowers. This plea comes as last year over £3.5 million* was lost to loan fee fraud and reports to the FCA consumer helpline increased by 44%**. 
Victims of loan fee fraud are often targeted while searching for loans online and are then contacted by fraudsters offering a loan. The scammer tells the victim they have to pay an upfront fee for the loan which they ultimately never receive. Once the first payment is made victims are often persuaded to make multiple payments – last year the average loss was £740*.
Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, FCA, said:
'We’re seeing an increasing number of cases of loan fee fraud reported to us. Fraudsters target people making online loan applications and who think they’re being contacted by a legitimate loan provider, when they are not at all.   
'Scammers take advantage of the excitement people feel when they are offered or accepted for a loan and make the loan conditional of an upfront fee, which can increase to hundreds of pounds. Of course, no loan ever materialises.
'Before applying for a loan always check who you’re dealing with, be sceptical, make sure the loan provider is authorised by the FCA. Check our register at fca.org.uk.'
In 2017 there were over 4,700 reports of loan fee scams made to Action Fraud. Additionally, it has now overtaken investment fraud as the most common scam reported to the FCA. Scammers target the most financially vulnerable in society, people on lower incomes and with low credit ratings, who have limited access to mainstream credit. 
New FCA research shows that 34% of those surveyed admitted they weren’t confident they knew how to check if a loan provider was legitimate. Additionally, 36% of those who took out a loan product in the last three years didn’t do any checks to ensure the legitimacy of their loan provider.
There are legitimate loan brokers who charge fees in advance of providing their services and are authorised by the FCA. However, being asked to pay a fee before receiving a loan can be a warning sign of this type of scam. To avoid scams it’s vital for consumers to check they are only dealing with authorised firms from the FCA register.   
Research shows that over a third of people (36%) usually just accept what financial firms tell them. Fraudsters take advantage of this attitude and have a range of genuine sounding reasons for asking for a fee - including claiming it’s a deposit, admin fee or insurance for those with low credit ratings. Other warning signs include:
being asked to pay in an unusual way e.g. by iTunes vouchers or a money transfer service
being put under pressure to pay the fee quickly
being asked to pay multiple fees
The FCA is encouraging the public to be wary if asked to pay an upfront fee for a loan as it could be a sign of a scam. The regulator is also urging people to only use authorised firms which you can check on the FCA’s online register. It’s important to make sure the contact information provided by the firm match the details on the register to ensure you’re dealing with the real firm.
The FCA assesses every loan fee fraud report received and will issue public warnings about unauthorised firms that breach our rules and target UK consumers. For unauthorised firms and individuals operating from within the UK, the FCA has a wide range of enforcement powers to protect consumers. These include taking civil court action to stop illegal activity and for the most serious cases, pursuing criminal prosecution.
Notes to editors
*Figures from Action Fraud.
** Figures from FCA Contact Centre, 888 reports in 2016 and 1276 reports received in 2017.
All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc. Total sample size was 2016 adults. Fieldwork was undertaken between 27th - 28th March 2018.  The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all GB adults (aged 18+).
On 1 April 2014, the FCA took over the regulation of consumer credit from the Office of Fair Trading. It introduced new rules for credit brokers in 2015. In particular, firms must make clear that they are a credit broker (not a lender) and so cannot guarantee a loan. In addition, any broker charging an advance fee must provide an ‘information notice’ stating that a fee will (or may) be charged, and the amount, and must get formal confirmation from the consumer before taking payment or asking for payment details. Failure to do so is a breach of FCA rules, and can lead to enforcement action.
Suspected loan scams can be reported to the FCA via the contact centre on 0800 111 6768. Fraud should also be reported to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or at www.actionfraud.police.uk.
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

Introduction: Keith Jackson, Director of General Insurance and Conduct Specialists in Supervision and Retail Authorisations
Transparency in insurance renewals
On 1 April 2017, the renewal rules came into effect to increase the transparency and engagement at renewal in general insurance. 
The rules require firms to:
disclose last year’s premium at each renewals to allow a comparison
encourage consumers to check their cover and shop around
identify consumers who have renewed 4 or more consecutive times and give them additional prescribed messaging 
We have been closely monitoring the sector to make sure firms made the changes required.  We found that Admiral included inaccurate premium amounts in renewal documents issued to some customers by publishing last year’s quoted premium, before discounts were applied, rather than what the customer actually paid. Admiral agreed to contact customers who may have been given inaccurate renewal information. We have also undertaken a small piece of multi-firm work which set out our findings and expectations. 
RAC is the latest firm to agree to contact affected customers after we found that their breakdown policy renewal documentation failed to display the prior and current year premiums and shopping around message as key information.
It is unacceptable that  firms continue not complying sufficiently with the renewal rules, a year on after the rules came into force.  Fair treatment of existing customers is an ongoing priority of ours, as set out in our Business Plan 2018/19. 
We take continued non-compliance seriously. We expect firms and senior management to take immediate action to make sure they are compliant.

Hot topics
Business plan, Fees CP and Sector Views 
On Monday 9 April, we published our 2018/19 Business Plan. We also published our Sector Views, Fees Consultation and Evaluation Framework. 
Our Business Plan 2018/19 sets out our key priorities for the coming year. The priorities in this year’s Business Plan reflect the high level of resource we need to dedicate to EU Withdrawal, given its impact both on our regulation and the firms we regulate. 
Alongside this work, we will focus on 7 cross-sector priority areas, based on assessments of where there is the greatest harm or potential for harm, and where intervention can have the greatest impact. 
The priority areas are: 
Firms’ culture and governance which should drive behaviours and produce outcomes likely to benefit consumers and markets.
High-cost credit, building on the significant impact already made in the market.
Tackling financial crime, including fraud, scams and anti-money laundering to make the UK financial services sector a hostile place for criminals and a safe place for consumers.
Data security, resilience and outsourcing since technology plays a pivotal role in delivering financial products and services.
Innovation, big data, technology and competition which are driving change in markets.
The treatment of existing customers to make sure that they don’t get less attention or receive poorer outcomes than new customers.
Long-term savings, pensions and intergenerational differences which reflect the changing UK population and their financial needs. 
Our Sector Views highlight the issues and developments we see within the sectors we regulate which help to inform our prioritisation decisions. 
We are consulting on fees for regulated firms for the 2018/19 financial year. This consultation will run until 1 June 2018. 
The final document we published is our Evaluation Framework Discussion Paper, setting out how we intend to assess the impact of our interventions, which we committed to doing in our Mission as part of the decision-making framework.
FCA publishes its Approach to Supervision and Approach to Enforcement 
We have published our Approach to Supervision and our Approach to Enforcement papers - the next in the series of documents we committed to publishing in our Mission. 
When we launched our Mission, we committed to being more open and transparent about how we regulate and why we make the decisions in the way that we do. We want to make sure that our regulation evolves with financial services rather than holding them back, and we’re keen to understand how and when regulation can provide unnecessary barriers to new firms entering the market. 
We want stakeholders’ views on a number of key issues including whether our guidance and approaches are clearly understood. Both the Approach to Supervision and Approach to Enforcement are open for consultation until 21 June 2018 and the final Approach documents will be published later in the year. 
Read more about our Approach to Supervision and Approach to Enforcement.
FCA warns public of increased threat of loan scams  
We are launching a campaign to raise awareness of loan fee scams - where victims are persuaded to pay an upfront fee for a loan they never receive. Scammers target the most financially vulnerable in society, people on lower incomes and with low credit ratings, who have limited access to mainstream credit. 
The campaign launches at the end of April and includes online advertising on social media, digital display and paid search. The advertising will also be supported by PR and partnerships with consumer groups and credit providers.

Easy read guide on everyday banking
We published an easy read guide on everyday banking aimed at helping autistic consumers better understand financial services. We have developed this guide in partnership with The National Autistic Society (NAS). The guide was published during World Autism Awareness Week, in an effort to raise awareness of the issues some autistic people face when accessing financial services. The guide has been created by the winning team of our Chief Executive Challenge, our graduate corporate responsibility programme.

Financial Advisers
The Basic Advice Regime after MiFID II and IDD
The impact of our implementation of the Re-Cast Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) and Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) on the basic advice regime is explained in a new web update.  
This update includes important information for firms selling stakeholder products using basic advice. These firms should read this update to make sure they understand the impact of MiFID II and IDD, and comply with our standards. 
It also directs firms to previously published information on providing streamlined advice to consumers.  
New rules and consultation on advising on pensions transfers
We published new rules and guidance on pension transfer advice and are seeking views on additional changes, including adviser charging structures, in particular whether we should ban contingent fees for pension transfer advice. The new rules and areas for discussion aim to improve the quality of pension transfer advice to help consumers make informed decisions for their individual circumstances. We have kept the position that an adviser should start from the assumption that a DB pension transfer will be unsuitable.
Thematic review of non-advised drawdown
We published a thematic review on non-advised drawdown. It assesses whether firms are providing necessary information at the right time and in a way that helps customers make informed decisions when accessing retirement benefits – as well as when reviewing whether their drawdown pension still meets their needs. We found firms are broadly meeting their obligations to communicate clearly with customers but that there is a risk of harm from customers not fully engaging with the information. The findings are closely aligned to the interim findings of our Retirement Outcomes Review and will inform the final report.

FCA publishes final rules and further consultation on asset management
In April, we published final rules, focused on the duties of fund managers as the agents of investors in their funds. We also published a consultation on proposed rules and guidance, focused on improving the information which investors get about funds. These followed on from the final report of our asset management market study in June 2017. 
We published a consultation on proposed remedies for funds to provide better information about what they offer. This includes proposals on:
how fund objectives can be expressed more clearly and be more useful to investors
making it clearer when funds are benchmark-constrained, or limited in how far their holdings can differ from the weightings of a benchmark index
making sure that if a fund uses one or more benchmarks, this is disclosed consistently and explained to investors 
We also published an Occasional Paper which looked at how different ways of presenting information about charges affected investors’ decision-making and their understanding and awareness of charges.

Consumer Credit
Four years of FCA regulation
We marked 4 years of FCA regulation of consumer credit at the end of March.  We published a video drawing together some of the key changes that we’ve made in this time, and the work we have still to do, with stories from consumers and Andrew Bailey talking about our commitment to a credit market that meets the needs of society.
FCA publishes rules and guidance on staff incentives and performance management
We have published rules requiring consumer credit firms to identify and monitor risks arising from their pay and performance management practices. We have also published final guidance which will support consumer credit firms’ compliance with the new rules. 
The guidance gives examples of good and poor practice found during our thematic review and outlines high risk elements of incentive schemes. We believe the guidance will be of interest to any firm with sales and collections teams.

EU Withdrawal
FCA preparation for EU withdrawal
The UK’s decision to leave the EU has, and will continue to have, a substantial impact on the way we work. This year we are increasing the level of resource dedicated to managing our work on EU withdrawal. We will continue to provide technical advice to the Government and to engage with international bodies, as well as working with regulated firms.  This is laid out in our Business Plan 2018/19.
Implementation period for withdrawal
We welcomed the agreement on the terms of a implementation period to operate from 29 March 2019 until the end of 2020, during which time firms and funds would continue to benefit from passporting. The implementation period forms part of the withdrawal agreement, which is subject to further negotiations between the UK and EU before it is finalised.
Passporting into the UK
Firms and funds currently benefiting from an EU passport need not apply for authorisation at this stage. This is in light of the agreement on the terms of an implementation period and HM Government’s commitment to providing for a Temporary Permission Regime as a backstop.
However, firms should complete our survey for EEA inbound passported firms by 11 May.

European Securities and Markets Authority guidelines on MiFID II product governance requirements
We have confirmed that we are compliant with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)’s guidelines on MiFID II product governance requirements.
We implemented the MiFID II product governance requirements in the PROD section of our Handbook as rules for MiFID firms and as guidance for non-MiFID firms. The requirements apply to manufacturers and distributors of MiFID financial instruments and structured deposits.
PROD and ESMA’s guidelines took effect from 3 January 2018. Firms in scope should have considered what steps they need to take to be compliant. ESMA’s guidelines can be viewed here.
FCA Financial Crime Guide: insider dealing and market manipulation
FCA Financial Crime Guide: insider dealing and market manipulation. 
We are consulting on changes to the Financial Crime Guide for firms (the Guide). We propose to add a chapter on insider dealing and market manipulation and make changes as a result of recent regulatory changes to make sure the guide remains up to date. The Guide, as currently drafted is available on the FCA website. 
Financial crime covers a broad range of criminal offences, including insider dealing and market manipulation. The Guide doesn’t currently provide guidance for countering the risk of insider dealing or market manipulation. We want to help firms by adding a new chapter to address these offences. 
We want feedback on our proposals. Details of our Guidance Consultation (including the new draft chapter), and how to respond can be found here.

New FCA data show 3.76 million complaints about financial services firms,Press Releases,19/04/2018,31/05/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/new-fca-data-show-3-76-million-complaints-about-financial-services-firms,"During the second half of 2017 a total of 3.76 million complaints were received, an increase of 427,032 on the first half of the year. Complaints about PPI rose by 40% to 1.55 million, the highest level of complaints about PPI for more than four years.
In January 2018 firms paid out £415.8m in redress to customers who complained about payment protection insurance (PPI). This is the highest figure since March 2016 and takes the amount paid since January 2011 to £30bn. 
Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy and Competition said:
'Having set a deadline for PPI complaints, we are encouraging consumers to decide whether they want to claim, and if they do, to make their complaint as soon as possible, as many already have. 
'We are continuing to monitor and challenge all firms to ensure they maintain the expected standards and are delivering on their commitments to make it easy for people to complain about PPI.
'When PPI is taken out of the mix, the numbers of complaints firms are receiving has remained stable. Firms should be doing all they can to reduce complaints and ensure they are treating customers fairly.'
Excluding PPI the number of complaints received by firms was 2.21million, around 13,000 fewer than the previous six months.
After PPI, the next most complained about products are current accounts, with 509,047 complaints and then credit cards with 314,586 complaints. Further firm-level data are available on the FCA’s downloadable tables.

Aggregate commentary
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

Payments after PSD2: evolution or revolution,Speeches,10/04/2018,10/04/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/payments-after-psd2-evolution-or-revolution,"Speaker: Karina McTeague, Director of Retail Banking SupervisionEvent: Pay360 Conference organised by the Emerging Payments Association, LondonDelivered: 1 March 2018Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version
Highlights
From a consumer protection and market integrity perspective, we have a real interest in the Open Banking Implementation Entity’s successful delivery of the CMA’s Open Banking API requirements and wider adoption of APIs by the industry.
Customer communications should be balanced, and not seek to dissuade customers from using third party AIS or PIS providers through their communications or terms and conditions.
We welcome the development of industry arrangements designed to facilitate the successful delivery of PSD2 objectives (including voluntary guidelines and dispute management system).
We will be looking to see that firms’ culture prioritises treating customers fairly, and doesn’t take inappropriate advantage of ill-informed, naïve or vulnerable consumers.
The media coverage at the launch of Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and Open Banking on 13 January 2018 gave a flavour of some of the services coming the way of consumers as a result of these regulatory changes - a glimpse of the future.
As a regulator, I’m often asked to look into my crystal ball and predict the shape and size of a market, and the winners and losers on the playing field.
As tempting as that is, I must decline. Especially as, looking at today’s agenda, there are many here who are better equipped to divine the future.
Instead, let me share my thoughts on some aspects of PSD2 and Open Banking from a regulator’s perspective.
PSD2 and Open Banking: opportunities
Undoubtedly, PSD2 offers opportunities: For consumers, financial services and - through retail businesses - for the UK economy.
It provides consumers with choice: choice to share their data in a way that allows them to take advantage of the newly regulated payment initiation service (PIS) and account information service (AIS). I want to stress the word choice. I’m hearing from banks and others that their customers are concerned that their data will be shared without their permission; that the new services envisaged by PSD2 will be foisted upon them.
It’s important that we all ensure consumers know and understand that the new AIS and PIS offerings are simply that: offerings that they can choose to accept, or not; and, if they do accept, that they can withdraw from at any time.
13 January was never going to be the start of a revolution; it was never going to be a big bang.
We don’t know what the tipping point or catalyst will be that will visibly change the landscape for consumers and businesses. Perhaps some of today’s speakers will be able to provide some insight.
But let me go through some real time stats and observations relating to firms applying for permission to deliver account information and payment initiation services.
Since we opened our doors for PSD2 applications on 13 October last year we have received applications from 59 firms for the two new regulated activities (account information and payment initiation services).
On 13 January we admitted 13 firms through the regulatory gateway to provide the new services (2 live-market and 11 new to market). Of these, 10 were registered account information service providers.
Since then we’ve authorised or registered 6 additional firms for the new regulated activities and a further 60 other PSD2 cases (including reauthorisations).
In terms of the profile of applicants:
some were already conducting activities under PSD1 and are applying for reauthorisation so they can expand into this new area
we are seeing firms which already operate extensively in other countries – and are seeking to move into the UK market with payment initiation services
These applications also cover a range of business propositions including:
consumer credit businesses (already authorised under FSMA) planning to extend the scope of credit reports and credit scores
existing live market firms producing financial dashboards for consumers
business services providers looking to help SMEs with financial forecasting and credit transfers
new FinTech applicants providing customers with services such as:rounding up a customer’s purchases to the nearest pound and then investing the digital spare change
storing consumers’ digital loyalty points, lightening the number of loyalty cards we carry in our purses and wallets

From a regulatory perspective, we regard 13 January as simply a key milestone in a longer-term/bigger picture plan.
From a regulatory perspective, we regard 13 January as simply a key milestone in a longer-term/bigger picture plan.
Other milestones are still to come. Of these, there are 4 key milestones I want to reference.
Three include changes designed to enhance secure delivery of account information and payment initiation services:
The first is a fully operational Open Banking API for the CMA9’s online current accounts and one-off payments.
Using an API reduces the potential harm from cyber-attacks because there is no need for the Third Party Providers to use or retain customers’ credentials.
So, from a consumer protection and market integrity perspective, we have a real interest in the Open Banking Implementation Entity’s successful delivery of the CMA’s Open Banking API requirements and wider adoption of APIs by the industry.
So, from a consumer protection and market integrity perspective, we have a real interest in the Open Banking Implementation Entity’s successful delivery of the CMA’s Open Banking API requirements and wider adoption of APIs by the industry.
Along with HM Treasury (HMT), we encourage the industry to move in this direction.
The second is when the Regulatory Technical Standards on strong customer authentication and common and secure communication come into force. These regulatory standards are intended to provide additional fraud protection by prescribing requirements for firms to ensure greater safety and security.
However, these standards aren’t expected to come into force until the second half of 2019, which creates a potentially uncomfortable transition period.
So, jointly with HMT, we have set out our expectations that, as an important mitigant against fraud and cyber risks during this transition period, firms should adhere to the principles of safety and security from 13 January. For example:
we expect firms to transmit credentials and data securely
to be transparent and open about their identities when inter-acting with one another
ensure data is held securely to mitigate the risk of illegitimate access
Banking and payments are increasingly about data. So the third key milestone is in May, when the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force. GDPR governs the treatment of personal data by all parties involved in handling data - forming part of the overall protective framework within which consumers and businesses can operate.
The fourth milestone is the proposed extension of the CMA9 specification for Open Banking APIs to all the payment accounts covered by PSD2, i.e. credit cards, e-money wallets and some types of online savings accounts – due in 2018/ 2019.
Looking forward, it will be interesting to see how this market develops. The generally held view is that the market will evolve; this will be a relatively ‘slow burn’ as:
existing businesses seek to adjust and adapt their business models
new entrants build their offerings and customer base
consumers become familiar and comfortable with the new services, their potential and their risks. I’ll expand on this point as I go on
What we are seeing is the development of an ecosystem; with opportunities for existing and new participants. But it’s a nascent ecosystem, the growth of which can be stunted by the ill-considered actions of any one of its component parts.
As an observer at the Open Banking Implementation Entity, we are seeing a new dynamic developing in the relationship between incumbents of retail banking and innovators within the payments sector.
Retail banking incumbents are weighing up the opportunities, and the threats, to their businesses of the innovation facilitated by PSD2 and Open Banking. Whilst innovators in the payments sector are looking to gain traction, scale and brand recognition.
Each can see the benefits of partnerships with each other – and the disadvantages. And each is aware of the over-arching and interdependent need to win and maintain public trust in this evolving market.
PSD2 and Open Banking are designed to create positive disruption so it is inevitable there will be tensions.
What is clear, though, is that all market players, across the retail banking and payments sectors, have an inter-dependent interest in the successful transition to the new world – whatever that might look like.
I’m not usually one for sporting analogies but, when I was thinking about what I’d be saying to you this morning, my school hockey playing days came to mind.
There was one fixture my team always dreaded. Not because we’d be beaten. Far from it. But because the quality of the pitch was so bad, we never had a decent game. As a result, neither team could attract enough supporters to cheer us along on those wet, windy Scottish Saturday mornings.
If PSD2 and Open Banking are the pitch, every team in the league, has a responsibility not to stunt the growth of the turf or muddy it up. We all want to attract supporters – the consumer.
At the FCA, we are aware of the challenges around the new regime. What we expect is that, as the teams work out their game plans, they make sure they don’t spoil the pitch for all.
Let me share with you, at this point, the FCA’s expectations, taking first our expectations of all firms we regulate within the payments eco-system, and then some specific expectations of those firms offering online payment accounts, such as current accounts.
We expect all firms we regulate within the payments eco-system, to:
put the fair treatment of their customers at the heart of their business models
work to realise the potential benefits of account information and payment initiation services
be aware of their broader legal obligations, particularly under secure data protection and consumer protection laws
fulfil their role in helping customers understand and take steps to protect themselves from the risks associated with fraud
in short, we expect the communications and information that firms send to their customers to be balanced and informative
So what do these expectations mean, in particular for banks and building societies?
Banks and building societies should allow their customers to make use of AIS and PIS in relation to those payment accounts without penalty, including allowing their customers to share their credentials.
Their customer communications should be balanced, and not seek to dissuade customers from using third party AIS or PIS providers through their communications or terms and conditions. I want to emphasise this point. Banks and building societies are an important source of information for customers about these new services. They need to fulfil that role in a balanced and socially responsible way. So, for example, banks might include in their customer communications:
balanced information about sharing banking and security credentials, distinguishing between regulated AIS/PIS providers and other unregulated services
an explanation that some ‘live market’ firms might legitimately continue to operate unregulated for a period of time
treat all AIS and PIS providers objectively and fairly, within the spirit of the legislation and in the interests of the customers in question
permit access through credential sharing, until they have an alternative means of allowing AIS and PIS providers to access those accounts (although, clearly, in all cases, denying access would be justified in circumstances related to fraud and unauthorised access on the account)
in the event that something goes wrong, such as a payment is misdirected or there is an unauthorised transaction, banks and building societies are required to reimburse their customers in the first instance and they should be clear that they are the first point of contact
Moving on
We recognise the ongoing uncertainty about elements of the EU rules over the next year or two, pending the Regulatory Technical Standards on strong customer authentication and common and secure communication coming into force.
I hope it will help if I set out our views on this.
We anticipate, and welcome the development, introduction and use of technology across industry, such as APIs.
However, the use of online banking credentials to access account data will continue in the transition period (and beyond for access to accounts not within the scope of the PSRs 2017). Indeed, this is a current practice reportedly used by service providers to 2 million consumers with, to our knowledge, no material complaints.
We expect all of industry to work in a way that delivers access in the interests of the end consumer or business customer, by improving security and facilitating innovation.
We expect all of industry to work in a way that delivers access in the interests of the end consumer or business customer, by improving security and facilitating innovation.
We welcome the development of industry arrangements designed to facilitate the successful delivery of PSD2 objectives (including voluntary guidelines and dispute management system).
We encourage industry to be transparent and fair in their interactions with each other as we collectively seek to enhance the opportunities that will be delivered by the effective uptake of these newly regulated services.
We urge all firms to participate in the work towards adopting common standards around APIs. We believe that the use of secure APIs provides significant advantages and we believe there are benefits to customers and market participants if these APIs are developed according to common standards and using secure common infrastructure where necessary.
Our Approach Document, and our joint communication with HM Treasury (July 2017), go into more detail and can be found on our website.
Our Payments Department
As I draw to a close, I’d like to mention the FCA’s own response to these changes in the payments landscape.
We have bolstered our payments strategic and supervisory capacity and capability so we can extend our programme of proactive engagement with existing payment services providers, and take on supervision of the newly regulated AISPs and PISPs.
Our supervisors will be looking to see that:
Firms’ culture prioritises treating customers fairly, and doesn’t take inappropriate advantage of ill-informed, naïve or vulnerable consumers.
Firms have sound systems and controls for:
effectively managing financial risks, such as safeguarding, and operational resilience
combatting the risk that they are used for financial crime and money laundering purposes
We will want to know that firms:
help their customers understand the account information and payment initiation services on offer:what the services are
what it is they’re consenting to
what will happen to the customer’s personal and account data

Where it will be shared, with whom and for what purpose:
how customers can complain
how customers can withdraw their consent
Conclusion
I want to sum up with two words: trust and opportunity.
Trust
I’ve previously said that PSD2 is an opportunity for banks to demonstrate their trustworthiness to their customers - and to consumers generally.
But trustworthiness is not a matter just for banks. It’s a matter for all players in the payments ecosystem. We all know that perceptions of trustworthiness are determined by actions and words.
Perceptions are also shaped by how these new services are portrayed in the media.
The payments and retail banking sectors are so inter-linked that where one player’s reputation is compromised, it affects the reputation of the ecosystem as a whole. Every firm in the ecosystem has a vested interest in each other ensuring good customer outcomes and market integrity, and helping educate and inform consumers through consistent and balanced messages.
Opportunity
The opportunities offered through PSD2 and Open Banking are undoubted. But they depend on the inherent risks being effectively managed.
Those risks can best be managed by the retail banking and payments sectors working together.
I’m already seeing positive signs of this. For example, the joint work being done by a number of trade associations, covering banks, building societies and payments firms, to agree voluntary guidelines for screen scraping.
This co-operative industry leadership is an important step towards helping consumers understand and build trust in the new services on offer, and realising the opportunities that PSD2 and Open Banking present.
There is another opportunity I want to finish on. A huge amount of work - across the whole industry - has already gone into the delivery of PSD2 and Open Banking. As a result, the UK has achieved a head start amongst its European competitors.
To maintain that advantage, I encourage the industry to continue to work together to deliver the benefits of PSD2 and Open Banking - for consumers, the industry and UK businesses.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

FCA publishes its Business Plan for 2018/19,Press Releases,09/04/2018,29/05/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-publishes-its-business-plan-2018-19,"The priorities in this year’s Business Plan reflect the high level of resource the FCA needs to dedicate to European Union (EU) withdrawal, given its impact both on our regulation and the firms we regulate.
Alongside this work, the FCA will focus on seven cross sector priority areas, based on assessments of where there is the greatest harm or potential for harm, and where intervention can have the greatest impact. The priority areas are:
Firms’ culture and governance which should drive behaviours and produce outcomes likely to benefit consumers and markets.
High-cost credit, building on the significant impact already made in the market.
Tackling financial crime, including fraud, scams and anti-money laundering to make the UK financial services sector a hostile place for criminals and a safe place for consumers.
Data security, resilience and outsourcing since technology plays a pivotal role in delivering financial products and services.
Innovation, big data, technology and competition which are driving change in markets.
The treatment of existing customers to ensure that they do not get less attention or receive poorer outcomes than new customers.
Long-term savings, pensions and intergenerational differences which reflects the changing UK population and their financial needs.
Andrew Bailey, FCA Chief Executive said:
'The Business Plan is an important way in which we are transparent about our priorities for the year. We recognise that this year we need to dedicate a significant amount of resource to withdrawal from the EU. As a result, setting our priorities this year has involved a particularly rigorous level of scrutiny and challenge to focus on areas where we see the greatest potential for harm.'
Alongside the Business Plan, the FCA is also publishing its annual fees Consultation Paper, Sector Views and a Discussion Paper on its evaluation framework.

On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

Cryptocurrency derivatives,Statements,06/04/2018,06/04/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/cryptocurrency-derivatives,"We are aware of a growing number of UK firms offering so-called cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related assets. As indicated in our Feedback Statement on DLT, cryptocurrencies are not currently regulated by the FCA provided they are not part of other regulated products or services.
Cryptocurrency derivatives are, however, capable of being financial instruments under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MIFID II), although we do not consider cryptocurrencies to be currencies or commodities for regulatory purposes under MiFID II. Firms conducting regulated activities in cryptocurrency derivatives must, therefore, comply with all applicable rules in the FCA’s Handbook and any relevant provisions in directly applicable European Union regulations.
It is likely that dealing in, arranging transactions in, advising on or providing other services that amount to regulated activities in relation to derivatives that reference either cryptocurrencies or tokens issued through an initial coin offering (ICO), will require authorisation by the FCA. This includes:
cryptocurrency futures – a derivative contract in which each party agrees to exchange cryptocurrency at a future date and at a price agreed by both parties
cryptocurrency contracts for differences (CFDs) – a cash-settled derivative contract in which the parties to the contract seek to secure a profit or avoid a loss by agreeing to exchange the difference in price between the value of the cryptocurrency CFD contract at its outset and at its termination
cryptocurrency options – a contract which grants the beneficiary the right to acquire or dispose of cryptocurrencies
If you are unsure whether your firm requires authorisation, the FCA’s general guidance on the regulatory perimeter in PERG may be helpful. We also encourage you to seek expert advice if you have any remaining questions.
It is firms’ responsibility to ensure that they have the appropriate authorisation and permission to carry on regulated activity. If your firm is not authorised by the FCA and is offering products or services requiring authorisation it is a criminal offence. Authorised firms offering these products without the appropriate permission may be subject to enforcement action.
Useful links
For further information on cryptocurrencies and ICOs, including the potential benefits and challenges of the underlying distributed ledger technology (DLT), please refer to Distributed Ledger Technology - Feedback Statement on Discussion Paper 17/03.
Furthermore, as indicated in our consumer warning on ICOs, an ICO may or may not fall within the FCA’s regulatory perimeter depending on the nature of the tokens issued.
We have also issued a warning on the risks of investing in cryptocurrency CFDs.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

FCA sets out next steps to improve competition in the UK’s asset management industry,Press Releases,05/04/2018,05/04/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-sets-out-next-steps-improve-competition-uk-asset-management-industry,"Today’s publications include:
Final rules following a previous consultation, focused on the duties of fund managers as the agents of investors in their funds
A consultation on proposed rules and guidance, focused on improving the information that investors get about funds
These documents address concerns outlined in the June 2017 final report of the asset management market study and are an important part of a wider package to improve competition in this industry for consumers.
The final rules and guidance cover:
a requirement for fund managers to make an annual assessment of value, as part of their duty to act in the best interests of the investors in their funds
a requirement for fund managers to appoint a minimum of two independent directors to their boards
the introduction of a new prescribed responsibility under the Senior Managers and Certification Regime to bring individual focus and accountability
technical changes to (i) improve fairness around the way in which fund managers profit from investors buying and selling their funds and (ii) facilitate the movement of investors into cheaper share classes
These measures will deliver better protection for all investors, both those who are actively engaged with their investments and those who don’t follow their investments closely.
To address its concerns that even actively engaged investors do not find it easy to choose which fund is right for them, the FCA is today publishing a further consultation on remedies related to funds providing better information about what they are offering. This includes proposals on:
how fund objectives can be expressed more clearly and be more useful to investors
making it clearer when funds are benchmark-constrained, or limited in how far their holdings can differ from the weightings of a benchmark index
ensuring that where a fund uses one or more benchmarks, this is disclosed consistently and explained to investors
The FCA has also today published an Occasional Paper setting out the results of behavioural research which looked at how different ways of presenting information about charges affected investors’ decision-making and their understanding and awareness of charges. This paper can be read here.
Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA said:
“The investment choices open to people, and the decisions they make on how to invest, can have a profound impact on their financial health. They can also have consequences for their families, as well as society as a whole. That’s why it is important the asset management industry, which looks after the savings of millions of investors, is working as well as possible. But our market study found evidence of weak price competition in a number of areas.
“Today’s announcements are an important part of a package of measures that, combined, aim to achieve a fair, transparent, open and accountable market.'
Firms have 18 months to implement the rules on assessment of value and appointment of independent directors and 12 months for the rules related to the way in which fund managers profit from investors buying and selling their funds.

Occasional Paper No. 32: Now you see it: drawing attention to charges in the asset management industry
FCA’s Asset Management Market Study
The FCA was assisted by members of the Fund Objective Working Group in developing the proposals on fund objectives, in conjunction with consumer input, as to how objectives may be explained more clearly to investors.
Alongside this, other work continues which will benefit investors by improving cost transparency. The FCA is supporting an independent Institutional Disclosure Working Group which is on track to make recommendations on a framework to support consistent disclosure of costs and charges to institutional investors.
Asset Management Market Study: Final decision to make a Market Investigation Reference on investment consultancy services
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

Information for investors in the Collateral Companies,News stories,04/04/2018,27/04/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/information-investors-collateral-companies,"The Collateral Companies operated a peer-to-peer lending platform through a website (collateraluk.com) and Collateral UK Ltd purported to hold an interim permission from the FCA to carry on regulated activities. In fact, none of the Collateral Companies held any valid authorisation or permission to carry on regulated activities. When challenged by the FCA, the Collateral Companies agreed to cease their lending activities and, on 26 February 2018, the lending platform became inoperative.
The Collateral Companies were required to obtain the approval of the FCA when appointing an administrator. This is designed to protect investors by ensuring an independent person conducts the administration in the best interests of the investors. This did not happen. Accordingly the FCA has intervened to ensure investors are protected as the law requires.
On 16 March 2018, the High Court adjourned the FCA’s applications to 27 April 2018. Until then, the Court ordered that, barring incoming payment of loan interest and repayments and certain other administrative steps, the substantive progress of the administration should be paused.
On 27 April 2018, the High Court in Manchester appointed new administrators to Collateral (UK) Ltd (Collateral UK), Collateral Sales Ltd and Collateral Security Trustee Ltd (together, the Collateral Companies) following an application by the FCA.  The Collateral Companies had been placed into administration by their Directors on 28 February 2018. The Court agreed that the appointment of the previous administrator had been invalid and has now appointed Messrs Shane Crooks and Mark Shaw of BDO LLP as joint administrators of the Collateral Companies to protect the interests of creditors.
The FCA took court action to ensure that the interests of creditors and investors affected by Collateral UK’s administration were properly protected and treated fairly by a validly appointed administrator who is independent of anyone connected to the Collateral Companies.
Creditors seeking information on the administration should contact BDO at [email protected] (for investors) or [email protected] (for borrowers) or go to the BDO website.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority
Guess who’s back? Animatronic Arnie returns to raise awareness of PPI deadline,Press Releases,04/04/2018,04/04/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/animatronic-arnie-returns-raise-awareness-ppi-deadline,"In the new TV ad and nineties and noughties themed radio adverts, Animatronic Arnie highlights that PPI was sold alongside a vast array of products which many people may not think of. These products include car finance, catalogue credit, credit cards, store cards and mortgages.
Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive of the FCA said:
“We know that PPI was sold on a huge variety of credit products throughout the 1990s and 2000s, but many people just don’t realise they had it.
“Since we launched our campaign the largest firms have told us that the proportion of people complaining to them directly has increased. This may in part be due to the improvements we asked firms to make to their complaint handling processes, including the introduction of online checking and complaining tools. This means that more customers get to keep more of the redress that they are due.
“We want people to act before the deadline. Dig out that old paperwork, visit our website or call our helpline to find out how to check if you had PPI and how to decide whether to complain.'
The new adverts will run on radio, social media, video on demand and outdoor advertising including bus stops. They will run alongside some of the existing adverts which first appeared in August.
Since the campaign launched on 29 August 2017 the FCA has received nearly 17,000 calls to its helpline and nearly 900,000 people have visited its campaign website.
People who want to discuss whether to complain about PPI can call the FCA’s dedicated helpline on 0800 101 8800 or visit the FCA’s website www.fca.org.uk/ppi for more information.

Insurance firms still failing to meet FCA general insurance renewal rules,Press Releases,03/04/2018,03/04/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/insurance-firms-still-failing-meet-fca-general-insurance-renewal-rules,"The rules, introduced in April 2017, require firms to clearly show the insurance premium a customer paid last year alongside their proposed renewal premium. They also require firms to show a prominent, clear and straightforward message to encourage customers to shop around. The FCA has found that firms are still failing to properly implement the rules despite warning in October about failings.
RAC has become the latest firm to agree to contact affected customers after the FCA found that the firm was failing to display the prior and current year premiums, and shopping around message as key information in its breakdown policy renewal documentation.
Jonathan Davidson, Executive Director of Supervision – Retail and Authorisations at the FCA said:
“It is simply unacceptable to see that some firms are still not being properly transparent with their customers a year on from the introduction of the rules.  Firms failing to get this right may have led to consumers losing out as they do not have the right information to decide whether or not to shop around.
“We have already acted where we have seen particularly poor practice in firms and will continue to do so where we see firms not being transparent. As we said in October, we expect other firms to take notice of these issues, to look at what they are doing and to make sure they are getting it right.'
The FCA outlined in October 2017 how firms were failing to meet the rules, highlighting four particular areas where it found firms were failing.  These were:
failing to implement the new rules for all products and customers;
misstating the previous years’ premium;
leaving out the shopping around message or not presenting it in a way which draws the reader’s attention; and
firms failing to properly identify all customers who needed renewal information either because of system error or a mistaken interpretation of the type of customer that is captured  by our rules.
The FCA expects firms and senior management in those firms to take immediate action to ensure they are compliant.
Any customer who feels that they did not receive the correct information from their insurance firm should contact them in the first instance.

Easy read guide on everyday banking,News stories,28/03/2018,13/04/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/easy-read-guide-everyday-banking,"Today we have published an easy read guide on everyday banking (PDF), aimed at helping autistic consumers better understand financial services. We have developed this guide in partnership with The National Autistic Society (NAS). We are publishing the guide during World Autism Awareness Week, in an effort to raise awareness of the issues some autistic people face when accessing financial services.
The guide has been created by the winning team of our Chief Executive Challenge, our graduate corporate responsibility programme. The challenge sees each new cohort of graduates tasked with sourcing and delivering a project or cause in our local area. The project should align with our objectives, and deliver public value to the local community.
The team knew it was important to understand the needs of their target consumer group, so they asked them what they needed to build their understanding of financial services. They were told that an easy read guide would be the most effective solution to the difficulties autistic consumers face with financial services. After winning the challenge, the team realised that the guide could benefit autistic consumers nationally.
The guide is set out in an easy read format. Easy read is particular way of formatting written information, and is designed to help a document’s readability. It increases readability by including images that are relevant to the text, and following a logical and concise structure.
Now we have published the guide, the team will work with stakeholders, including The National Autistic Society, to ensure it reaches a wide range of consumers who can benefit from accessing information on financial services in an easy-to-read way.

A key issue is the need for continuing authorisation for firms which are undertaking cross-border business between the UK.
We need to work with EU regulators to find common solutions.
It’s a great pleasure to be at the APPG Annual Dinner. I have to start by emphasising that neither I nor the FCA take a position on whether Brexit should happen – that has been decided by a vote of the people of this country, and the subsequent processes are for the Government and parliament. We provide all the support we can to get it done, and to do so consistent with the FCA being able to achieve its statutory objectives. Our sleeves are rolled up, so to speak.
I strongly welcome last week’s European Council agreement on a transitional arrangement. This is no small achievement for everyone involved.
I will use my time first to explain why a transitional or implementation period is important for everyone involved in financial services on both sides, and what we need to do to make best use of that time. I will then go on to offer a few thoughts on what we should look for in the end-state. But I want to start by summarising the situation today in terms of the broader financial stability position as regards Brexit.
At its recent meeting, the Bank of England Financial Policy Committee (FPC), of which I am a member, renewed its judgment that a wide range of UK macroeconomic outcomes could be associated with Brexit, that these outcomes acceptably fall within the scope of last year’s UK bank stress test and thus that the UK banking system could continue to support the real economy through a disorderly Brexit should that be the outcome (and, to be clear, the FPC was not judging that this would be the outcome).
The FPC further noted that a combination of a disorderly Brexit, severe global recession and major misconduct costs could result in more severe conditions than in the stress test, but that the likelihood of this combination materialising is extremely remote to use the FPC’s words, and hence we did not judge that the risks around Brexit warrant additional capital buffers for banks.
But we recognised that Brexit could disrupt the financial system directly. In November the FPC set out the main issues here and a checklist of actions that would mitigate risks of disruption to important financial services used by households and businesses. We have made progress since November towards mitigating these risks of disruption.
On the UK side, I would particularly point to the announcements last December by the Treasury, Bank of England and the FCA which sought to provide greater clarity and confidence on how the UK authorities will handle those risks of disruption.
Nonetheless, material risks remain, particularly in areas where actions would be needed by both the UK and EU authorities. In the latest FPC statement we set out under three headlines those areas where action would be required to mitigate the risk of disruption to end users of financial services.
The three headings are: legal frameworks, preserving the continuity of outstanding cross-border contracts and avoiding disruption to the availability of new financial services. We have re-emphasised the importance of continuing preparations and actions to be taken by relevant authorities to tackle the risks.
Making the most of the transition period
Let me turn now to the importance of making the most use of the transition or implementation period. Over the last year, we have devoted a lot of time and effort to building a clear understanding of the risks that would crystallise in the event of an exit that does not provide for the continuity of existing financial services contracts, and in important areas such as cross-border data sharing and how that can continue in order to support contracts.
A key issue here is the need for continuing authorisation for firms which are undertaking cross-border business between the UK and the EU, and for which their passporting rights would be lost on the UK leaving the EU. Firms that rely on these rights would be unable to perform regulated activities in order to meet their contractual obligations until they gain authorisation from the state in which they were undertaking such cross-border business. Though all financial industry contracts requiring a cross-border performance of a regulated activity could be affected, the impact is expected to be greatest for insurance policies and derivative products.
A key issue here is the need for continuing authorisation for firms which are undertaking cross-border business between the UK and the EU
Insurers in the UK and the European Economic Area may not be able to pay claims, or receive premiums from policyholders in the other jurisdiction. In the UK this could affect around £27bn of insurance liabilities and 10 million policyholders, while in the EEA the numbers could be around £55bn of liabilities and 38 million policyholders.
For uncleared derivatives, this could affect a quarter of contracts entered into by parties in both the UK and EEA, with a notional value of £26 trillion. For cleared derivatives, the notional amount of outstanding contracts that could be affected is over £70 trillion, of which around £27 trillion matures after Q1 next year.
A key point here is that these risks are symmetric in that they affect both the UK and the EU. This is not one-sided risk, far from it. I think this point is now well understood. What is less well understood, to date, is what we should do about it working together, since as I will emphasise later, we share a common concern to preserve financial stability. This is where the transition or implementation period provides the opportunity to come together and enact solutions to these issues, working together and thus reducing risks to financial stability.
The best mitigation of those risks would be an agreement between the UK and the EU on the treatment of existing contracts which would enable firms to perform regulated activities and be confident that the regulatory regime would be supportive. The objective of such a solution would be to support financial stability and to support consumers and users of financial services in the UK and EU.
The role of regulators in the transition period
But we are not there yet.  I recognise that formal agreement and adoption of a transition or implementation period depends on everything being agreed. Meanwhile, markets and firms, and regulators, want as much certainty as they can get. So, we need urgently to consider what we as regulators can do to give the arrangements the necessary confidence. The best thing we can do is to engage openly and speedily together to work on solving these transition issues, and thus achieving our joint objectives of financial stability and consumer protection. We need to work with EU regulators to tackle these issues together, to find common solutions, and thereby to give confidence that as regulators we will put into effect as smooth a transition as possible.
Of course, we have to have fallbacks in place. Last December, the UK Government committed to legislate to allow EEA firms to continue to operate and thus service contracts.  This would take effect through a regime that granted temporary permissions for such firms, thus enabling business as usual. At the FCA we are strong supporters and proponents of this idea. We have some experience with temporary permissions.
We therefore have a fallback plan, and that is important, but it would be much better for the regulators to show that we are taking practical steps to use the transition or implementation period to good effect, and in doing so to contribute practical solutions to that process.
To emphasise, engagement and goodwill between regulators can help to embed transition
Such a period will also be useful because it will allow firms to plan in the knowledge of the expected outcome of decisions on future relations between the UK and the EU.
To emphasise, engagement and goodwill between regulators can help to embed transition in a practical sense. So, at the risk of labouring the point, now is the time for a much deeper regulatory engagement, and in doing so we can give practical substance to the transition or implementation period.
Supporting trade between the UK and EU
Let me move on to say a few words about what comes next in terms of the negotiation on the end-state relationship between the UK and the EU. I have said it before several times and I am a very strong supporter of free trade and open markets in financial services. I find it somewhat humbling to come and speak to an All Party Group from Parliament which was the birthplace of modern free trade, which saw the advocacy of Richard Cobden and John Bright, and the bravery and far-sightedness of Sir Robert Peel.
Today, these issues of free trade and open markets are back with us again. In financial services, it is primarily about wholesale markets. These markets are global, they are not regional. We learned this, as if we needed to, a decade ago when we experienced a global financial crisis. Good regulation lies at the heart of pursuing the public interest to ensure we don’t have another crisis like that one. We share the objective of preserving financial stability.
I am encouraged that I see progress in establishing an understanding that it is possible to have a free trade agreement that encompasses financial services. And it is possible to embed the public interest in financial stability and consumer protection in such an agreement. We can agree the outcomes that we should commit to in order to uphold those public interest objectives, after all that is what we have been doing for the last decade.
it is possible to embed the public interest in financial stability and consumer protection in such an agreement
I want to end by emphasising the importance of and benefits from open financial markets, particularly wholesale markets. UK markets are highly open and have remained so notwithstanding the experiences of the crisis. It would have been tempting to retreat from such openness following the crisis, but it would have been the wrong thing to do. History provides an interesting lesson here, because by the end of the nineteenth century there was a strong challenge to the UK’s approach of unilateral free trade.
We may find ourselves debating unilateral free trade again. I hope not. Speaking in Hastings just before the 1892 General Election, Lord Salisbury argued that British commercial policy, which was oriented towards unilateral free trade ‘may be noble, but it is not business’. With all due respect, I don’t agree. Open wholesale financial markets with appropriate regulatory standards operating to support the public interest are a global public good which benefits businesses everywhere.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority
FCA statement on EU withdrawal following the March European Council,Statements,28/03/2018,28/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-statement-eu-withdrawal-following-march-european-council,"The implementation period is intended to operate from 29 March 2019 until the end of December 2020, during which time European Union law would remain applicable in the United Kingdom, in accordance with the withdrawal agreement. Firms and funds would continue to benefit from passporting between the UK and EEA during the implementation period. Obligations derived from EU law would continue to apply and firms must continue with implementation plans for EU legislation that is still to come into effect before the end of December 2020. Consumer rights and protections derived from EU law would also continue to apply.
The implementation period forms part of the withdrawal agreement, which is subject to further negotiations between the UK and EU before it is finalised. We will monitor developments and update as necessary.
In light of the agreement on the terms of an implementation period and HM Government’s commitment to providing for a Temporary Permission Regime as a backstop, firms and funds currently benefiting from an EU passport need not apply for authorisation at this stage.
Temporary Permissions Regime for firms and funds passporting into the UK
In December 2017, the Government announced its plan to legislate for a Temporary Permission Regime if necessary. This would enable relevant passporting firms and funds to undertake new business that falls within the scope of their existing permissions, enable them to continue performing their contractual rights and obligations, manage existing business and mitigate risks associated with a sudden loss of permission.
Subject to HM Government’s legislation setting up the regime, our expectation is that firms and funds that will be solo-regulated by the FCA will need to notify us of their desire to benefit from the regime.  Notification will not require submission of an application for authorisation. We will set out further details on these proposals later in the year.
On 9 March 2018, the FCA launched a survey to collect information from EEA firms and funds who would like to participate in the regime and the FCA would encourage firms to complete this.
EU (Withdrawal) Bill
The EU (Withdrawal) Bill will repeal the European Communities Act 1972, and convert existing EU law at the point of exit into UK law. The Bill gives powers to Ministers to bring forward secondary legislation to amend this retained EU law to ensure that it functions effectively once the UK is no longer a member of the EU.
The FCA continues to work with HM Treasury and the Bank of England/PRA to ensure the UK’s legal and regulatory framework functions on EU withdrawal in any scenario. This includes ensuring that the FCA Handbook functions effectively when the UK is no longer a member of the EU. We will set out further details in due course.
Firms and funds passporting into the EEA
The implementation period would permit firms and funds to continue to benefit from passporting between the UK and EEA until the end of December 2020. UK firms and funds passporting into the EEA should discuss with their relevant EU regulator the implications of a transitional period for their contingency planning. The FCA will continue to cooperate closely with the home state regulators of EEA firms and the European Supervisory Authorities, and we stand ready to work with them to address any risks to consumer protection and financial stability.

FCA launches call for input on the use of technology to achieve smarter regulatory reporting,Press Releases,20/02/2018,21/02/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-launches-call-input-use-technology-achieve-smarter-regulatory-reporting,"The FCA regularly explores how technology can make our regulations more efficient and reduce the regulatory burden on firms. One of the ways we do this is through ‘TechSprints’ that bring together financial services providers, technology companies and subject matter experts to develop solutions to regulatory challenges.
In November 2017, the FCA and the Bank of England, held a two-week TechSprint to examine how technology can make the current system of regulatory reporting more accurate, efficient and consistent. All regulated firms submit data to the FCA based on their financial activities. The data received from these regulatory reports are critical to our ability to deliver effective supervision, monitor markets and detect financial crime.
At the TechSprint, participants successfully developed a ‘proof of concept’ which could make regulatory reporting requirements machine-readable and executable. This means that firms could map the reporting requirements directly to the data that they hold, creating the potential for automated, straight-through processing of regulatory returns.
This could benefit both firms and regulators. For example, the accuracy of data submissions could be improved and their costs reduced, changes to regulatory requirements could be implemented more quickly, and a reduction in compliance costs could lower barriers to entry and promote competition.
The collective demand on firms reporting regulatory data to the FCA is significant. Every year the FCA receives over 500,000 scheduled regulatory reports from firms, as well as additional ad hoc reports.
The Call for Input outlines how this ‘proof of concept’ was developed and asks for views on how the FCA can improve this process. The paper also seeks feedback on some of the broader issues surrounding the role technology can play in regulatory reporting.
Christopher Woolard, FCA’s Executive Director of Strategy and Competition commented:
‘Technology is a powerful shaper of financial regulation, able to make compliance simpler and more efficient. Our TechSprints bring people from across the financial services world together to share their collective knowledge to solve common problems. We look forward to working with industry participants in the coming months to drive these ideas forward.’
The Call for Input will close on 20 June 2018. We will publish a feedback statement summarising the views received and the proposed next steps in Summer 2018.

FCA and US CFTC sign Arrangement to collaborate on FinTech innovation,Press Releases,19/02/2018,19/02/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-and-us-cftc-sign-arrangement-collaborate-fintech-innovation,"Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive of the FCA, commented: 'International borders shouldn’t act as a barrier to innovation and competition in financial services and that is why agreements like the one we have signed today with the CFTC, a forward looking and proactive regulator, are so important.  As our first agreement of this kind with a US regulator, we look forward to working with LabCFTC in assisting firms, both here in the UK and in the US, who want to scale and expand internationally in our respective markets. As part of the Arrangement, the FCA and the CFTC will be hosting a joint event in London to demonstrate how firms can engage with both regulators.'
“The FCA’s Project Innovate is the gold standard for thoughtful regulatory engagement with emerging technological innovation,' said CFTC Chairman Giancarlo. Therefore, I am delighted to join Andrew Bailey in this arrangement to demonstrate our cross-Atlantic commitment to facilitating market-enhancing innovation and sharing best practices in FinTech engagement. This is the first FinTech innovation arrangement for the CFTC with a non-US counterpart.  We believe that by collaborating with the best-in-class FCA FinTech team, the CFTC can contribute to the growing awareness of the critical role of regulators in 21st century digital markets. Our LabCFTC FinTech effort grew out of a bipartisan commitment to innovation, and I thank my fellow CFTC Commissioners Brian Quintenz and Russ Behnam for their continued leadership on these issues.'
The Cooperation Arrangement on Financial Technology Innovation (FinTech Arrangement) focuses on information-sharing regarding FinTech market trends and developments. It also facilitates referrals of FinTech companies interested in entering the others’ market, and sharing information and insight derived from each authority’s relevant sandbox, proof of concept, or innovation competitions.
The Fintech Arrangement follows the creation of FCA Innovate in October 2014 and LabCFTC in May 2017. Among other activities, these initiatives were set up to help businesses with innovative ideas navigate the regulatory landscape and engage with the regulator. To date, the FCA’s Innovation Hub has supported over 500 businesses and the authorization of 43 businesses. LabCFTC has engaged with over 150 entities since its launch last year, published its first primer on the topic of virtual currencies, and soon will seek public feedback on a planned 2018 innovation competition.
The FinTech Arrangement supports both regulators’ efforts to facilitate responsible FinTech innovation and ensure international collaboration on emerging regulatory best practices.

However, some firms act without our authorisation and some knowingly run investment scams. 
This firm is not authorised by us and is targeting people in the UK. Based upon information we hold, we believe it is carrying on regulated activities which require authorisation.

Introduction: Sarah Rapson, Director of Authorisations
Consulting on our Approaches to Authorisation and Competition
Welcome to the February edition of Regulation round-up. 
Every day people across the UK rely on a range of financial services, from basic bank accounts to car loans, mortgages, pensions and complex investment products.
They need to have confidence in these services and the firms that provide them. They expect the market to be fair, open and competitive. They have high expectations of those who regulate these firms.
Authorisation is the gateway to the market. Firms wishing to provide regulated financial services and products must have our authorisation. Individuals holding important functions in those firms must be approved by us.
Through authorisation and supervision we ensure that they meet minimum standards and continue to meet them for as long as they are authorised.
Regulation can hinder market entry. It can be complex and hard for firms to understand. It has not always kept up with market innovation, with some firms operating business models the rules did not foresee. Regulatory uncertainty or complexity in the authorisations process can deter firms from entering the market. These challenges can pose an even greater barrier for firms that are new to the market, innovative or both.
Until 12 March 2018 we are consulting on our Approach to Authorisation and our Approach to Competition.
In Approach to Authorisation we explain: the purpose of, and our approach to, authorisation; the public value it delivers and changes we are making to improve our approach.
We describe how we use authorisations as a regulatory tool, primarily to prevent harm. We do this by ensuring that regulated firms and individuals meet common sets of minimum standards; to improve conduct standards and culture in firms and to promote competition and innovation.
We want your views on the contents of the papers and your responses to four consultation questions. 

Hot topics
FCA/Practitioner panel survey
Most of the firms regulated by the FCA are classified as smaller firms, whether by market capitalisation, funds under management, size of balance sheet or number of employees. Many of these firms will now have received an invitation to take part in the joint FCA and Practitioner Panel survey which we featured in last month’s Regulation Roundup.
The FCA Smaller Business Practitioner Panel (SBPP) provides input into the survey and uses its findings to help with its work. One of the issues the SBPP has raised is that smaller firms in particular may have little resource available for activities which are not compulsory, such as responding to complex consultations. This can result in the voice of smaller firms being lost.
The survey is an opportunity for smaller firms to speak directly to the FCA and share their views and concerns. We’ve streamlined this year’s survey to make it easier for you to complete – if you are one of the firms randomly selected to take part, it should only take around twenty minutes of your time. 
You can find out more about the survey and last year’s results and more about the Practitioner and Smaller Business Practitioner Panels on their website.   
The fair treatment of existing interest-only mortgage customers
We published the findings from our thematic review on ‘the fair treatment of  existing interest-only mortgage customers’.  The review covered 10 lenders representing approximately 60% of the UK interest-only residential mortgage market.  It follows on from the publication of Guidance in 2013 on ‘Dealing fairly with interest-only mortgage customers who risk being unable to repay their loan’. 
The review assesses the steps lenders have taken since our published guidance and examines how customers who engage with their lender are being treated.  We commissioned some consumer research to understand why large numbers of customers are not engaging with their lender.  
We found that lenders are actively trying to communicate with their customers to understand repayment strategies and to provide appropriate and affordable solutions where needed. However, most of their interest-only strategies are based on writing to customers at specific times before maturity. Where lenders had segmented customers and adopted contact strategies tailored to the different customer types identified, they were able to increase contact with customers who are considered higher risk.
We are encouraged to see that lenders have taken positive steps to engage with and help their interest-only borrowers.  However, as volumes of maturities start to increase towards 2028/29, it is important that lenders take time to review and enhance their strategies.  
The customer research identified a number of strategies which may help boost engagement with customers.  We will continue to monitor this risk as part of our ongoing activity through regulatory data and other sources such as complaints and market intelligence.

Financial Advisers
Requirements when providing Pension transfer advice
We have recently written to all firms holding the permission to advise on pension transfers and opt-outs to remind them of our requirements when providing pension transfer advice. The full text of the letter is on our website and we recommend any advisers holding the permission who have not read the letter should do so. We also suggest any advisers considering offering such advice in the future should familiarise themselves with our requirements.
Guidance for uploading professional standards data to Gabriel
We have published guidance to help firms with the submission of their professional standards data (part of the Retail Mediation Activities Return (RMAR) section G). This is particularly helpful for firms with large numbers of advisers to report, reducing the amount of retyping required from firm records. The guidance explains how firms can use the XML extract and upload functionality in Gabriel (our online system for collecting and storing regulatory data from firms).
Pensions strategy
The FCA and The Pensions Regulator (TPR) are working together on a pensions regulatory strategy, which will set out how we will work together to tackle the key risks facing the pensions sector in the next 5-10 years. We will hold a series of events with stakeholders in London, Edinburgh and Manchester in the spring.

Consumer Credit
High cost credit review and rent-to-own - updates
We have published an update on progress in our review of high-cost credit, including overdrafts, as well as a separate update on our work on the rent-to-own sector.  We want to promote alternatives to high-cost credit and address some of the drivers for demand alongside tackling poor conduct and harm to consumers.
Significant further analysis of how consumers use overdrafts has reinforced our concerns and we remain of the view that fundamental reform of this market may be necessary to protect consumers.  We also set out some specific issues of concern in other high-cost credit markets, and are committing to take forward several initiatives to encourage better use of alternatives to high-cost credit.

Office for Professional Body Anti Money Laundering Supervision (OPBAS)
OPBAS has begun its work, under regulations which came into force on 18 January 2018. OPBAS is hosted within the FCA, and has responsibility for overseeing the standards of anti-money laundering supervision by the professional body supervisors outlined in Schedule 1 to the MLRs 2017. This is part of a suite of measures by the Government as part of a wider package of reforms to strengthen the UK’s AML supervisory regime.  We recently published our specialist sourcebook for professional body supervisors  that  sets  out expectations in relation to anti-money laundering supervision.

FCA and PRA appoint new Chair of the FSCS,Press Releases,13/02/2018,13/02/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-and-pra-appoint-new-chair-fscs,"Marshall Bailey has worked in financial services for over two decades, and has held senior positions in a number of firms. He has worked on issues around financial reform and conduct, most recently on the Board of UKFI. In addition, Marshall is currently a non-executive Director at Chubb European Group and CIBC World Markets in the UK.
The FCA’s Executive Director of Strategy and Competition Christopher Woolard, who chaired the selection panel, commented:
'We have conducted a thorough recruitment process to identify the most suitable person to become the next Chair of the FSCS. Marshall Bailey was selected from a strong field of potential candidates by a panel comprising members of the PRC, FCA and FSCS Boards. Marshall brings a wealth of experience from the financial services industry and we look forward to working with him in his new role at the FSCS.'
Commenting on his appointment, Marshall Bailey said:
'I am delighted to be joining the FSCS as its new Chair. The FSCS is a critical component of the UK’s regulatory infrastructure, and vital to the trust we place in our financial system. The FSCS works closely with banks, insurers and building societies throughout Great Britain, as well as with providers of investment and pension advice. As with protection schemes throughout the world, the FSCS’s role as a “lifeboat fund' protects our financial services customers when things go wrong.
'The work previously done by Lawrence and the FSCS Board has been excellent, and I thank them for the work they have done to provide a resilient platform through a difficult period. Mark Neale and the executive team are deeply dedicated to ensuring that this continues, and that consumers, especially vulnerable ones, are protected.'
Lawrence Churchill, Chair, commented:
'I have been proud to serve as Chair of FSCS over the last six years, during which time we have paid over £1.8bn in compensation to customers who have lost out and recovered £13.2bn from the estates of failed firms including those who failed during the financial crisis and subsequently. This includes the Icelandic banks and Bradford & Bingley.'
Notes to editors
The FCA and the PRA are required by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) to appoint the Chair of the FSCS, with the appointment being approved by HM Treasury.
Marshall Bailey has held senior positions at RBC Capital Markets and State Street Bank & Trust. He has worked on issues around financial reform and conduct, most recently on the Board of UKFI Ltd and as a member of the Market Practitioners’ Group for the FX Global Code of Conduct. In addition to UKFI, Marshall is currently a non-executive Director at Chubb European Group and CIBC World Markets in the UK, and on the volunteer board of the CFA Society of the UK.
On the 1 April 2013, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well.  To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

Automated technology brings significant benefits to investors, including increased execution speed and reduced costs. However, it can also amplify certain risks. It is therefore essential that key oversight functions, including compliance and risk management, keep pace with technological advancements.
The report focuses on five key areas within algorithmic trading compliance in wholesale markets:
Defining Algorithmic Trading
Development and Testing Process
Risk Controls
Governance and Oversight
Market Conduct
Megan Butler, Director of Supervision – Investment, Wholesale and Specialist at the FCA, said:
'This report is relevant for all firms developing and using algorithmic trading strategies in wholesale markets. Firms should consider and act on its content in the context of good practice for their business.'
The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) has also published a consultation paper on proposed expectations regarding a firm’s governance and risk management of algorithmic trading. The PRA publication is a formal consultation on a supervisory statement which sets out expectations for the prudential aspects of risk management and governance of algorithmic trading at PRA regulated firms.
The FCA will continue to work with the PRA to ensure coordinated approaches going forward.

This work will also be informed by the FCA’s research and TPR’s ongoing ‘TPR Future’ program, as well as other factors such as the outcome of the Work and Pensions Select Committee’s inquiry into the pension freedoms and the impact of the Department for Work and Pensions’ review of automatic enrolment.
The pensions landscape
The last 5 years have seen significant change in the sector.  For example, the introduction of the pension freedoms, which changed the way that people can access their retirement savings, and of automatic enrolment, which has seen more than 9 million people newly saving into workplace pension schemes.
Regulating the sector - our approach
For the FCA, this has meant making sure that our regulation provides the appropriate level of consumer protection and competition within this new landscape, whether this is through the establishment of Independent Governance Committees or ongoing work such as the Retirement Outcomes Review.
For TPR, the focus has been on protecting workplace pension savers through a drive to improve standards of governance in schemes, ensuring schemes are being treated fairly by sponsoring employers, and that workers are enrolled into the pensions they are entitled to by employers as part of automatic enrolment.
As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the sector works well for consumers and workplace pension savers, we are working together on a pensions strategy which will look at how we will work together, and with stakeholders, in the coming years.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority
Convicted illegal money lender sentenced to three and a half years imprisonment,Press Releases,09/02/2018,15/02/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/gopee-convicted-illegal-money-lender-sentenced,"In addition to this custodial sentence, Mr Gopee has been issued with a Serious Crime Prevention Order (SCPO), which will severely restrict his ability to carry out this type of crime in the future. This is the first time the Financial Conduct Authority has sought such an order, which underlines the seriousness of his conduct.
Between 2012 and 2016, Mr Gopee acted as an illegal lender despite being refused a consumer credit licence by the OFT, or securing any authorisation from the FCA. He loaned money to vulnerable consumers at high rates, securing the loans against their property, and then sought to take possession if they failed to pay. Over the 4 year period, his own loan books showed that he issued approximately £1 million of new loans and took in at least £2 million in payments from old and new consumers, none of whom were aware that did not have a licence.
The SCPO will begin on Mr Gopee’s release from custody, and will last for five years. It includes conditions prohibiting him from conducting any business in the credit sphere, limits the number of bank facilities he is permitted to operate, and requires him to make disclosures of those banking facilities to the FCA. Breaching the terms of the order is a criminal offence, punishable by up to five years' imprisonment.
In sentencing Mr Gopee, trial judge HHJ Beddoe noted that Mr Gopee was aware of the regulator's serious concerns, but ignored them, deciding instead to “… deliberately flout the law' ignoring the fact that he had lost his licence, and endeavouring to enforce agreements he knew were unenforceable but that debtors did not. He continued to pressurise debtors with demands for payment, threatening court action that he knew could not be sustained.
Commenting on the defendant’s activities as a whole, the judge said that Mr Gopee’s business practices “… exploited the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of many, many people …' who were unaware that their trust in him was misplaced. He described the new scheme constructed by Mr Gopee as involving one contrivance after another in an attempt to get around the law, showing “a horrid pattern of exploitation'.
Mark Steward, Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:
“The court is sending a very clear message that deliberate and repeated offending will lead to long periods of imprisonment. Today’s decision also imposes the FCA’s first Serious Crime Prevention Order which will severely inhibit Mr Gopee’s ability to reoffend and should protect consumers in the future. The FCA will continue to take whatever action is necessary to bring offenders to justice and protect consumers.'
Mr Gopee had already been banned from acting as a company director, having been disqualified on 5 May 2016 for the maximum period permissible of 15 years under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. A number of his companies have already been wound up in the public interest following proceedings by the Official Receiver, and he has also been the subject of a restraint order obtained by the FCA on 25 June 2015 under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.
Following the lifting of a reporting restriction, we are now able to report that the FCA had to bring two sets of proceedings against Mr Gopee for contempt of court in relation to repeated breaches of that restraint order.
In April 2016, having denied various breaches - including failing to disclose assets, continuing to deal with assets, opening and using new accounts - Mr Gopee was found to be in contempt and imprisoned for a term of 18 months. He was released early by the court in September 2016 having promised to comply with the order. However, he went on to commit various additional breaches. Further proceedings were therefore brought against him, and on this second occasion, having admitted the new breaches he was imprisoned for a term of 15 months in October 2017, in the lead up to his criminal trial.
Mr Gopee continues to serve his 15 month term of imprisonment for contempt, and his sentence for the recent offences will begin after that term has been completed in June 2018.
Proceedings have now begun at Southwark Crown Court to confiscate the proceeds of Mr Gopee’s criminality.
Notes to editors
If you believe you have suffered a financial loss as a result of this criminality, please email [email protected] or call 020 7066 7807.
When Mr Gopee became aware that the FCA were investigating him, he wrote a letter on the 31 January 2015 in an attempt to obtain a response that he could use to sanction his conduct. HHJ Beddoe described the letter as a “contrived conceit'. It was wholly disingenuous, deliberately hiding the true nature of his conduct.
On the 1 April 2013 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers

FCA and ICO publish joint update on GDPR,Statements,08/02/2018,13/02/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-and-ico-publish-joint-update-gdpr,"The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will apply in the UK from 25 May 2018. It is an essential step forward in enhancing the privacy and security of personal data. The GDPR will be regulated and enforced in the UK by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Financial services firms will need to consider how the GDPR will apply to them, and ensure that they are ready to comply with the regulations from May 2018.
Complying with some of the FCA’s rules requires financial services firms to process personal data. Firms have asked us about their ability to comply with both the GDPR and rules made by the FCA. We believe the GDPR does not impose requirements which are incompatible with the rules in the FCA Handbook. Indeed, there are a number of requirements that are common to the GDPR and the financial regulatory regime detailed in the Handbook.
Compliance with GDPR is now a board level responsibility, and firms must be able to produce evidence to demonstrate the steps that they have taken to comply. The requirement to treat customers fairly is also central to both data protection law and the current financial services regulatory framework. When the FCA makes rules, we take into account how our requirements will affect the privacy interests of individuals such as firms’ customers and employees, and are open and transparent on why we have made rules in the way that we have.
However, we recognise that there are still ongoing discussions to ensure specific details of the GDPR can be implemented consistently within the wider regulatory landscape.
The FCA and ICO are working closely together in preparation for the GDPR, and recently jointly hosted a GDPR Roundtable with firms and industry bodies to listen to industry concerns. One example of how we are working together is innovation, where the ICO is providing tailored input to the FCA’s Innovation Hub.
Since 2014, the FCA and ICO have had a Memorandum of Understanding in place, laying out our formal relationship and demonstrating our commitment to co-operation and co-ordination in our activities. Over the coming months, we will review the memorandum of understanding to ensure it is still fit to address future collaboration.
While the ICO will regulate the GDPR, complying with the GDPR requirements is also something the FCA will consider under their rules, for example, the requirements in the Senior Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls (SYSC) module. As part of their obligations under SYSC, firms should establish, maintain and improve appropriate technology and cyber resilience systems and controls.
The FCA and ICO will continue to collaborate in the coming months to address concerns firms raise and support firms’ preparations for the introduction of the GDPR in May 2018.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority
Dharam Prakash Gopee guilty of acting as an illegal money lender,Press Releases,08/02/2018,15/02/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/dharam-prakash-gopee-guilty-acting-illegal-money-lender,"Update 9 February 2018: Convicted illegal money lender sentenced to three and a half years imprisonment
The trial of Dharam Prakash Gopee concluded today at Southwark Crown Court with the jury returning a guilty verdict to the charges brought by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for offences under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. 
Mr Gopee described himself as “a lender of last resort' and engaged with consumers who were often vulnerable and in difficult circumstances. He regularly registered charges over the homes of borrowers to enable him to take possession of a property if the borrower failed to pay the debt.
The offences related to Mr Gopee’s operation of money lending businesses from August 2012 to December 2016 despite neither having a consumer credit licence from the OFT, nor any authorisation from the FCA.
During the period from August 2012 to December 2016, he entered into 147 new credit agreements with new consumers, for sums totalling over £1,000,000. He also continued to collect on pre-existing loans with no authorisation to do so, sending ledgers applying high rates of monthly compound interest, making demands for payment, registering charges over consumers’ properties and pursuing court actions for money judgements and for possession.
In an effort to avoid the relevant regulations, Mr Gopee invented a complex new type of agreement for his lending which the prosecution alleged was simply a work of fiction.
Under this agreement, consumers would purportedly sell their home for the value of the loan, often as little as £2,000 - £5,000, to one of Mr Gopee’s companies. Another company owned by Mr Gopee then purportedly loaned the purchase money to the first company to finance the transaction. The consumer was given a licence to remain at the property on the condition that they pay the monthly liability under Mr Gopee’s intercompany loan. In this way, Mr Gopee claimed he was not entering into consumer credit agreements directly with consumers.
In reality, the complex new agreement was nothing more than a cover for Mr Gopee to continue lending to often vulnerable consumers in the same way that he had before. The inter-company mortgage between his companies only existed on paper, and none of the consumers who gave evidence in court understood or believed that they were selling their home in order to obtain the loans that they were seeking. 
Mark Steward, Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said: 
“Unauthorised money-lending is a criminal offence and causes serious harm, often to vulnerable communities. Mr Gopee’s actions showed utter contempt for the law. The FCA will continue to take whatever action is necessary to stop this misconduct.'
The case has been listed for 10am on Friday 9 February 2018 for sentence.
Notes to editors
What offences had he breached?
Two offences contrary to S.39(1) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 of carrying on a consumer credit business without a licence between 17 August 2012 and 1 April 2014, and two offences contrary to S.23(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 of carrying on regulated activities (regulated credit agreements) without authorisation or exemption between 31 March 2014 and 16 December 2016.

Until 31 March 2014, consumer credit was regulated under a licencing regime by the Office of Fair Trading. Following that date, regulation transferred to the Financial Conduct Authority who have operated an authorisation regime, requiring prospect consumer credit lenders to obtain authorisation.  Only one company run by Mr Gopee ever had a credit licence – Reddy Corporation Limited – and the OFT refused to renew its licence. Mr Gopee’s appeals against that decision were unsuccessful. In refusing his appeal, the First Tier Tribunal (Credit) found that Mr Gopee failed to adhere to relevant consumer protection regulations, treating them as discretionary, and failed to deal with consumers fairly.
Mr Gopee has registered over 1,000 charges over consumer properties at HM Land Registry.
An alternative offence included in the indictment relating to entering regulated Sale and Rent Back agreements did not require a verdict from the jury.
Mr Gopee wrote to the FCA on behalf of two of his companies on 31st January 2015 (two and half years after first using his new model) in an attempt to obtain a confirmation from the authority that his practice did not fall to be regulated. Mr Gopee said: “We are involved in lending short term finance to Limited Companies. We do not deal with individuals … We are writing to enquire whether we need to be authorised by your organisation to do this type of business.' [Mr Gopee’s emphasis] The FCA submitted this correspondence into evidence before the jury as it demonstrated, the prosecution said, a wholly disingenuous approach to the authorities, deliberately hiding the role of consumers in his dealings.
On the 1 April 2013 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well.

Highlights
We are treating Brexit as a high priority and will do our utmost to make it work in the interests of the people of this country.
There is a range of operational issues arising from Brexit which, if not tackled, will create financial stability risks and issues for both the UK and the European Union (EU).
We are working with the Government to take action to ensure we have a functioning regulatory regime from day one by implementing the EU withdrawal bill.
It is a great pleasure to be here this evening and to have the opportunity to discuss the Future of the City.
I would imagine you will be unsurprised to know that I am going to talk about Brexit. So, I need to begin with some important disclaimers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) takes no position on the issue of whether Brexit is a good thing or not. Appropriately, that decision has been taken by the electorate of this country. It is our job to roll up our sleeves – though if you don’t mind, at this time of year, I will treat this as a metaphor – and do our duty, which is to serve the public interest. We are giving it the highest priority, and we will do our utmost to make it work in the interests of the people of this country.
I want to start with something that I know at other times would have been regarded as a statement of the blindingly obvious, bordering on a platitude. London is a global financial centre, just as it has been for several centuries. The world of finance has changed beyond recognition in this time, but London has remained a global financial centre, indeed the pre-eminent one. This is no longer a platitude, as I will explain.
The second important opening comment is that global financial markets are, as the term indicates, open. Free trade in financial services means open markets, and most particularly for wholesale markets which are at the heart of the City. What does this mean in reality? For wholesale markets, it means that a firm operating in the UK – whatever its legal entity status here – can trade with a professional counterparty in any other country. It's that simple on the surface.
But, of course, it isn’t that simple under the surface. What underpins that freedom to trade is not a trade agreement of the long-established sort – it's not about the World Trade Organisation (WTO), very important though the WTO is in other spheres of activity. It's not about tariffs or import quotas or licensing agreements. No. It’s about mutual recognition of regulatory standards which appropriately protect the public interest.
The public interest is paramount in terms of the framework for open markets. We can date much of the foundations of free trade back to the seminal work of Adam Smith and David Ricardo. It was Smith in 'The Wealth of Nations' who wrote that the business interest is 'always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public'. It is the role of regulation to reconcile these differences while preserving the public interest. And, in doing so, it provides the foundations and framework for open markets and thus free trade in finance.
If as a response to Brexit the European Union wishes to change the status quo, it would amount to a decision to close market access, not a decision about whether to open it. It would also be a decision to disconnect the EU from the benefits of global markets.
The big point here is that if as a response to Brexit the European Union (EU) wishes to change the status quo, it would amount to a decision to close market access, not a decision about whether to open it. It would also be a decision to disconnect the EU from the benefits of global markets. As I will come onto, in my view this would have serious adverse consequences, and by no means just for the UK. It would only be justifiable if the UK was derelict in its protection of the public interest through its regulatory standards. You will be unsurprised to hear that I would oppose this strongly. I strongly endorse the view of the European Commission as set out by Vice-President Dombrovskis, that the lesson of the financial crisis is that financial stability is best protected by co-ordinating rules and supervision. And, I would add that this is the way to preserve open financial markets. 
I want now to tackle the issues facing us in the two by now familiar parts: issues around the transition; and issues around the future steady state.
Phase One: The Transition to Brexit
There is a range of operational issues arising from Brexit which, if not tackled, will create financial stability risks and issues for both the UK and the European Union. These issues have been discussed at length in recent months, and have been set out by the Financial Policy Committee. Just as they are symmetric in impact, so they are in the mutual interest of the UK and the EU to tackle. I think this point is increasingly understood on both sides. It is not a matter of scaremongering to get negotiating advantage.
Let me briefly set out a number of them, starting with so-called contract continuity. When the UK departs from the EU, unless action is taken, a wide range of financial contracts between UK and EU counterparts could cease to be serviceable, in particular in insurance and derivatives. This could affect up to £26 trillion notional of derivative contracts (of which £12 trillion extend beyond the end of March next year) and at least 30 million EU and 6 million UK insurance policyholders. It would affect individuals, businesses, economies and financial stability.
The issue arises where services provided each way in an existing contract between UK and EU counterparties may only be provided by an entity which is either authorised in the local market or passported under the Single Market rules. Thus, when the UK leaves the EU, those relying on a passport which at that point falls away, may be in breach of local law. In most EU member states and the UK, servicing an insurance contract includes collecting premiums and paying claims. In derivatives, the same definition can include trade compression, rolling an open position or exercising an option. These actions are critical to effectively managing the risk of derivative positions, cash flow, margins and capital requirements.
If we turn to central counterparties (CCPs), if the UK leaves the EU without mitigating action on both sides, EU and UK CCPs could find they are in breach of regulation by providing clearing services in the other’s jurisdiction. This would apply to maintaining existing positions as well as taking on new positions. This would require abrupt close-out of positions, with attendant financial stability risks and costs to real economies. I would add that this risk is more acute for EU users because of the volume of activity conducted in UK CCPs.
The last issue I will set out concerns data. EU and UK firms hold and share a very large amount of data about each other’s citizens. It is thought that around three quarters of cross-border data flows involving the UK are with EU member states. The UK is a major exporter of digital data services such as data hosting and processing, and is the entry point to Europe for many global data-dependent businesses. The FCA itself is a major exporter of data on trading activity, helping other European regulators oversee firms and markets. In fact, in an average month we export over 250 million trade reports, compared with the 12 million we receive. If the UK was to leave the EU without mitigating actions on both sides, holding and sharing each other’s data may be in breach of national law.
We are working with the Government to take action to ensure we have a functioning regulatory regime from day one by implementing the EU withdrawal bill.
What is to be done about all this? We are working with the Government to take action to ensure we have a functioning regulatory regime from day one by implementing the EU withdrawal bill. The aim of the work is to ensure that, so far as possible, the same rules and laws will apply on the day after exit as on the day before and provide certainty and confidence to business. On its own, the legislation does not solve the operational issues I have just described, because they are symmetric in the sense that they affect both sides, and in important areas they result from the loss of the passport regime which goes with exit. But, there are solutions for all these issues. 
The least good – in fact bad – solutions are to leave them to firms to sort out. These solutions would be expensive, messy and prone to risk, and would take much longer to enact. The second best – but distinctly inferior – approach would be for each of the UK and EU authorities to enact solutions at the official level but independently.
The best solutions are mutually agreed and enacted so that they are consistent. And to achieve this, we need by the end of March a joint commitment by the political authorities to a well-defined Implementation or Transition Period which will create the space and support for the regulators to work with firms and political authorities to put practical solutions into place. The benefits of a transitional period go beyond the need for time to deal effectively with these operational issues, but the latter are nonetheless important. 
It can be done, and I think there is a growing consensus on both sides that it must be done. I sense this view increasingly taking hold from my discussions around Europe. But it needs support in the form of a timely commitment to a transition agreement which will allow the regulators to get on and tackle these issues. A joint agreement to get on with this is in the interest of everyone involved. And, it will give much needed assurance to firms and markets as well as regulators. As the International Monetary Fund (IMF) set out in December, a solution would be most efficiently achieved through co-ordinated official action.
We need by the end of March a joint commitment by the political authorities to a well-defined Implementation or Transition Period.
As an important step in this direction, I welcome the announcement by the UK Government and the EU in December that there should be a transitional arrangement. I also welcome the announcement by the UK Government that it is prepared to bring forward secondary legislation to ensure that contractual obligations can continue to be met in the UK. These provide important safeguards on the UK side, but do not mean that we should forsake the better outcome of a co-ordinated solution.
As part of this co-ordinated solution, I hope that the respective regulators can put in place a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to give effect to a stable and orderly transition which would acknowledge that firms are planning for a transition period to be in place. An MoU would be a means for the regulators to be transparent in the more practical issues around implementation, and thus that we are committed to such a period of time being available. 
We have taken an important step in the direction of contingency arrangements by introducing the plan that we would use interim permissions as a means to deal with the risk that firms are left without authorisations without due warning. We think this is an important safeguard and a sensible way to underpin financial stability. I am grateful to the Government for committing to introduce the secondary legislation needed to put such an arrangement in place.
Phase Two: The Steady State Future
Let me now move on to what the future could look like after transition. I said earlier that for me a commitment to continued open markets is at the heart of the future, and that regulatory standards operating in the public interest underpin open markets. At the heart of such an arrangement is mutual recognition of regulatory standards. This is quite different from passporting. Let me conclude on transition. As an impartial technician, I cannot stress too much that we need these arrangements in place, and co-ordinated solutions are in the best interests of both sides. We are ready with sleeves rolled up to get on and put these arrangements in place.
The European Union has a history of strong commitment to global free trade. After all, like the Bretton Woods institutions, it emerged out of the desire to avoid the horrors of war and the causes of that war, including the breakdown of free trade and the resort to protectionism between the wars. The EU is, of course, a regional trade bloc, but I don’t believe that it has ever been part of the objective of the EU to pursue regional free trade and global protectionism. The EU has a history of high ideals.
I hope that the respective regulators can put in place a Memorandum of Understanding to give effect to a stable and orderly transition.
And, we can see this in practice, in a very important way, in the approach the EU took to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations with the US, where the EU pursued a trade agreement which included provision for financial services. The US wasn’t ready for such a move, but this doesn’t take away from the fact that to its credit, the EU proposed such an arrangement. And what this meant was a proposal for close regulatory co-operation which could underpin broad mutual recognition and thus a commitment to ensuring open markets. The European Commission drafted a TTIP chapter on financial services. So, it turns out that it can be done, and moreover there is an extant proposal from the EU which could be a good starting point for UK-EU mutual recognition. The EU has also taken over 200 equivalence decisions on third country jurisdictions in financial services. So, when I hear that there is not a single trade agreement open to financial services, I think, 'really?'. And, it would not have to involve a loss of regulatory autonomy.
When I hear that there is not a single trade agreement open to financial services, I think, 'really?'.
If you don’t mind, I am now going to spend just a few minutes talking about fish. It's a new subject for me, so bear with me. Fish have an annoying habit. They swim across borders. What is the relevance to financial services? Well, I was struck the other day to read a set of slides put forward by the European Commission on how to deal with this annoying habit of fish, which we have to assume they will continue to do post-Brexit. So, the European Commission in its slides suggested a fisheries agreement to maintain the status quo with reciprocal access to waters, fish stocks and markets, with respect for historic rights and quotas, seeking the highest level of convergence in management regimes and a bilateral EU-UK Partnership Agreement on fisheries. It's not for me to opine on fishing policy. But, the key point is that this sounds like the fishing equivalent of open financial markets.
So, the moral of the story, to borrow a quote, 'You can get it if you really want'. And, if it is possible to envisage a partnership agreement on fishing based on convergence of regimes, of course it is possible to have open financial markets and mutual recognition of regulatory regimes, just as the TTIP proposal envisaged.
The principles for mutual recognition would look a lot like the ones we already use to authorise the branches of banks from outside the European Economic Area, namely broad equivalence of regulation in terms of outcomes, supervisory co-operation and good information sharing. We would need to add on a robust dispute resolution arrangement, but this could be done. We are used to working very closely with other regulators, it is a big part of our job given London’s international role.
And let me comment on the negative arguments – ie the arguments against not having mutual recognition. First, it is not sensible to imagine material regulatory divergence, especially in wholesale financial markets. It is a false concept. Markets are global and we cannot in practice diverge much in terms of regulatory outcomes, and regulatory arbitrage is not an allowable ground for competition.
Second, fragmentation of financial markets is not a price worth paying, for either side. Take clearing houses as a case in point; they reap benefits by being multi-currency. Segregating currencies reduces the depth of liquidity pools and increases costs. It is in no one’s interest. Fragmented markets reduce diversification and transparency, thereby increasing risk.
Finally, is it possible to properly assess the quality of regulation across regimes? Yes, and that is what the IMF does every four years in its Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) reviews. So, let me repeat what the IMF said about the UK in the last review in 2016.
Five years ago, the financial system had stabilised but still faced major residual weaknesses. This FSAP found the system to be much stronger and thus better able to save the real economy. Like all systems, the UK financial system is exposed to risks. Given its size, complexity, and global interconnectedness if these risks were to materialise they could have a major impact not only on the UK but also on the global financial system. Financial stability in the UK is thus a global public good. At the same time, understanding, mitigating and staying a step ahead of the evolving risks is such a complex system, as well as a constant analytical and policy challenge for UK policy-makers and regulators. 
Conclusion
Whatever view you take on Brexit, I think we all agree that financial stability comes first as a common objective. It would have been easy in the aftermath of the financial crisis to conclude, wrongly in my view, that the better way to achieve financial stability was to step back from open financial markets. To the great credit of everyone involved, led by the G20 and the Financial Stability Board, that did not happen, and instead regulation has been strengthened to protect financial stability and provide the necessary foundation for open markets.
In the UK, the authorities recognise and take into account the global systemic financial nature of the financial system, and where necessary we enact higher standards to reflect this. In short, of course it is possible to have open financial markets based on mutual recognition of regulatory standards, and of course it is possible to assess the application of those standards to ensure broad equivalence.   
Thank you.

FCA seeks feedback on non-workplace pensions,Press Releases,02/02/2018,02/02/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-seeks-feedback-non-workplace-pensions,"The FCA estimates that non-workplace pensions, also known as individual private pensions, collectively represent around £400bn assets under management. This is more than double the amount invested in contract-based Defined Contribution (DC) workplace pension schemes. Research suggests that at least 1 in 4 adults have accumulated benefits in non-workplace pensions.
The FCA is seeking feedback to better understand the market for non-workplace pensions, including whether competition is working well and if there are issues that need to be addressed in order to protect consumers.
Christopher Woolard, FCA Executive Director of Strategy and Competition, said:
“In recent years we, alongside the Department for Work and Pensions and the Pensions Regulator, have taken a number of steps to address weaknesses in the workplace pensions market. We believe it is now right to look at the other side of the picture and assess whether competition is working in non-workplace pensions.
“A diverse group of people save into non-workplace pensions and it is a growing market. We want to hear from anyone with an interest in this subject about how they think the market is working.'
The FCA is looking to understand how the differences and similarities between the workplace and non-workplace markets impact competition and consumer outcomes. The particular areas of focus include:
product complexity. Most pensions are complicated products and product performance may not become apparent for many years
the factors which may reduce consumer motivation and ability to invest time and effort in decisions related to their pensions
whether customers can identify and freely move to more competitive products
fund choice and the use of defaults. The FCA is concerned that informal defaults may be operating in the market for non-workplace pensions that are not subject to the same protection as defaults in workplace pensions
The FCA is also looking at whether providers are competing on charges and if there are barriers to consumers identifying, and choosing, from more competitive products.
The FCA is seeking feedback by 27 April 2018. The FCA will consider responses and will then look to collect data to better understand any problems identified.
Notes to editors
Effective competition in non-workplace pensions: DP18/1
Non-workplace pensions include individual personal pensions (IPPs), stakeholder personal pensions (SHPs) and Self Invested Personal Pensions (SIPPs) as well as Free Standing Additional Voluntary Contributions (FSAVCs), s32 buyouts, and retirement annuities.
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

Nausicaa Delfas appointed Executive Director of International,Press Releases,01/02/2018,01/02/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/nausicaa-delfas-appointed-executive-director-international,"In this role, Nausicaa will be responsible for setting and growing the FCA’s strategy for international engagement, and leading its delivery. This will involve leading relationships with foreign regulators, governments and other stakeholders, and facilitating the FCA’s work to shape the global regulatory agenda and international policy. 
She will also be leading the delivery of the FCA’s response throughout the process of withdrawal from the EU, providing technical support to HM Government, and continuing to work closely with EU27, international regulators and the financial services industry, to ensure a smooth transition.
In light of the importance that the FCA places on international engagement, Nausicaa will be a member of the FCA’s Executive Committee, reporting to CEO.
Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive of the FCA commented:
'I am delighted to appoint Nausicaa as Executive Director of International.  This is a new and vital role for the FCA, reinforcing our focus on the global regulatory agenda, and importance of international co-operation. It is also critical for our work throughout the process of EU withdrawal.
'I’d also like to welcome back Georgina Philippou to her role as Chief Operating Officer after a period of extended leave.’
Nausicaa, Executive Director of International, commented:
'I look forward to leading the FCA’s strategy for international engagement and working closely with colleagues in the international regulatory community, and the financial services industry. The work which we do internationally is vital to the delivery of our objectives, and it has become increasingly important given the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.'
Nausicaa has been acting Chief Operating Officer and a member of the FCA’s Executive Committee, since November 2016. During this time she made continued improvements, bringing a more strategic and business focussed approach to operations.
Previously, she was Director of the Specialist Supervision Division, leading on FCA's approach to IT and cyber resilience, financial crime, client assets and resolution, prudential regulation and complex cases, across all sectors. She had been actively engaged on a national and international level on these issues.
Prior to this she has held many senior roles at the FSA in Supervision, Risk and Policy Divisions, across different industry sectors.
She has led innovative and complex reviews, often involving building new functions and expertise – for example, the transfer of consumer credit regulation from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to the FCA on 1 April 2014.  
Nausicaa joined the FSA's Enforcement Division in 2000, where she led investigations and disciplinary actions in retail and wholesale markets.
She is a solicitor, having trained and qualified at City law firm Freshfields in London, where she specialised in EU and financial services law.

Samrat Bhandari sentenced in FCA prosecution of £1.4 million investment scheme,Press Releases,31/01/2018,31/01/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/samrat-bhandari-sentenced-fca-prosecution,"In sentencing, Judge Loraine-Smith stated that Mr Bhandari had been ‘entirely self-centred and devious’, demonstrating “not a shred of regret' for what he had done nor any sympathy to the investors. He described Mr Bhandari using the enterprise as his ‘cash cow’. The Judge said ‘regulation it seems means nothing to you.’
Bhandari, who was convicted following a trial at Southwark Crown Court lasting 49 days, had offered to repay the investors in the scheme but later withdrew his offer in a move described by the judge as ‘another example of your manipulative nature’.
His sentence follows that of Dr Aleem Mirza, Michael Moore and Paul Moore who were also given sentences of imprisonment at an earlier hearing for their involvement in the investment scheme which attracted more than 300 investors.
Commenting on the case, Mark Steward, Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:
‘Mr Bhandari was the controlling mind in this scheme and he deliberately abused his position as a corporate advisor to exploit hundreds of vulnerable investors for his personal gain. This prosecution by the FCA reflects our commitment to protect investors by bringing the operators of unauthorised investment schemes such as this to justice and the sentence shows how seriously the courts view this kind of offending.’
The FCA has already commenced confiscation proceedings against each defendant with a view to recovering from each the benefit they gained from their criminal conduct. In due course, the FCA will invite the Court to order that sums confiscated from the defendants are used to compensate the victims of their crimes.
Between 2009 and 2014, mainly elderly and vulnerable investors were targeted and mis-sold shares in Symbiosis Healthcare plc (‘Symbiosis’) through a combination of cold-calling, pressure sales and the publication of exaggerated promotional material. Symbiosis was set up by Dr Aleem Mirza and purported to be a successful company offering ‘healthcare solutions’ in Dubai and elsewhere in the world. In reality, the shares in the company were effectively worthless and investors lost a total of just over £1.4 million in the scheme. Samrat Bhandari, as director of William Albert Securities Ltd, acted as corporate advisor to Symbiosis and organised the selling of Symbiosis shares, while brothers Michael and Paul Moore were part of a team of brokers.
The FCA was assisted in the investigation and prosecution by a number of other law enforcement and government agencies, including the City of London Police, as well as by a number of investors in the scheme.
Notes to editors
Samrat Bhandari was sentenced to 3½ years’ imprisonment for Count 1 (creating a false impression, contrary to section 397(3) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA)); 15 months’ imprisonment for Count 2 (carrying on a regulated activity without authorisation, contrary to sections 19 and 23 FSMA); and 3½ years’ imprisonment for Count 4 (creating a false or misleading impression, contrary to section 90 Financial Services Act 2012). The sentences are to run concurrently. Count 3 was ordered to lie on the file. He was also disqualified from holding the position of director for 12 years.
On 20 December 2017, Muhammad Aleem Mirza and Michael Moore were both sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment and Paul Moore was sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment. Muhammad Aleem Mirza was also disqualified from being a director for 8 years. Read a more detailed sentencing press release.
Samrat Bhandari and Muhammad Aleem Mirza were convicted on 30 November 2017 following trial. Michael Moore and Paul Moore had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing. Read a more detailed press release about the prosecution.

FCA publishes update on high-cost credit work,Press Releases,31/01/2018,31/01/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-publishes-update-high-cost-credit-work,"The update follows a Feedback Statement the FCA published in July 2017 which identified key areas of concern with the sector including overdrafts, rent-to-own, home-collected credit and catalogue credit.
Work undertaken since July 2017 has demonstrated an emerging picture of the case for intervention in a number of markets but also some limitation on what can be achieved purely through traditional regulatory interventions.
As well as being prepared to propose new rules where it has the evidence that markets are not working well for consumers, the FCA is prepared to look at solutions designed to increase the choice and availability of alternatives to high-cost credit. It will look at the guidance given to social landlords and others about referring to cheaper sources of credit and is also proposing to work with government to highlight examples of best practice around alternative models.
The FCA considers that it is important to avoid negative unintended consequences from taking steps that might restrict the availability of credit to those consumers who are able to repay it affordably.
Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy and Competition said:
'High-cost credit products remain a key focus for us.  We have already taken significant steps to address the risk they pose to potentially vulnerable consumers by putting in place new rules for high-cost short-term credit firms and taking supervisory and enforcement action against non-compliance across all credit markets.
'This review and the analysis we have conducted so far give an emerging picture of the need to intervene in some parts of the market.  At the same time we can also see the social utility of these credit products.  We need to address both the choice and range available and how this market can work better for consumers.'
Overdrafts
The FCA remains concerned about the high fees and charges for unarranged overdrafts, especially when compared to the relatively small amounts lent. The FCA has conducted detailed analysis of how consumers use their overdrafts, looking at the transaction history of 1.5 million personal current accounts.  The data have shown that while arranged overdrafts are a larger source of revenue for firms than unarranged overdrafts, the proportion of revenues from unarranged overdrafts is significantly higher when compared to the amounts lent. Over half of the total charges paid on unarranged overdrafts were applied to just 2% of accounts.
We are taking this work forward alongside our Strategic Review of Retail Banking Business Models, and this analysis of overdrafts will feed into that Review (see Notes to Editors below). 
Rent-to-own
FCA supervision and authorisation work on rent-to-own has already driven significant improvement in the sector and reduced the risk of consumer harm.
However, concerns remain about the cost of using such services particularly when add-on products are included, and the FCA continues to gather evidence in this area as part of its review of the market.
Home-collected credit
The FCA is focusing on home-collected credit consumers’ repeat borrowing and refinancing, particularly where people take out additional borrowing with the amount outstanding from the previous loan incorporated into the new loan.  There are concerns that when consumers refinance their loans in this way, it may result in them paying significantly more interest on the amounts originally borrowed than they would had they maintained separate loans. The FCA has requested further data from firms on their lending patterns and the nature and extent of refinancing to examine ways in which other borrowing options could work better for consumers.
Catalogue credit
Catalogue credit also remains a concern for the FCA, particularly the complexity of charging structures and how people are offered choices to make repayments. These mean many consumers may not understand key features or may not be making informed choices.  The FCA is gathering evidence on firms’ policies including information they provide to customers and doing consumer research to better understand consumer use of these products.
Alternatives to high-cost credit
The FCA has set out a series of commitments on initiatives to support greater consumer access to alternatives to high-cost credit. This includes working with government to clarify our expectations of social landlords and others so that they can feel confident in signposting their clients to alternatives to high-cost credit.  The FCA will also highlight best practice that lowers the demand for high-cost credit, such as providing white goods when tenants move into a new property.  The FCA is also inviting innovators in this space to bring forward ideas that are in the interest of consumers and test them if necessary as part of the FCA Sandbox.
Next steps
In most areas the FCA intends to publish conclusions and proposals for consultation in the Spring.  Overdrafts will be addressed as part of the FCA’s Strategic Review of Retail Banking Business Models, which will be reporting later this year.
Notes to editors
Update on High Cost Credit
Update on rent-to-own
The FCA is undertaking a Strategic Review of Retail Banking Business Models to better understand the models and this analysis of overdrafts will feed in to that Review. The Review is looking particularly at whether free-if-in-credit banking leads to concerns about the distribution of profits from different types of consumers or different products. The Strategic Review will provide the FCA with valuable insight into the interlinkages between different elements of personal current accounts and retail banking products, including overdrafts.

Rent-to-own – update,News stories,30/01/2018,16/02/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/rent-to-own-update,"Since then our supervision of rent-to-own firms has sought to ensure that customers are treated fairly and firms comply with our standards.
Since 2014, our supervisory work with the firms has achieved better outcomes for consumers. Firms are now more transparent when displaying the cash value of goods, the amount of interest to be paid, and the total cost to customers.
Our work has also resulted in the unbundling of compulsory warranties and insurance. These are now offered separately and customers are able to obtain their own insurance cover instead.
Together these developments help consumers understand what they are paying for and make it easier to compare prices with other retailers. 
We have also seen the firms change their business models in response to our concerns – including how they assess affordability and the action they take to help those in long term financial difficulties.
Our supervisory work has so far resulted in nearly £16m of compensation being paid to around 308,000 consumers by two firms, BrightHouse and Buy As You View. This compensation relates to historic poor practices including unaffordable lending and inappropriate charges and fees. If we discover any further instances of consumer harm, we will require the firms to put things right for any affected consumers.
Alongside, and in conjunction with, our supervision work, these firms have had to set out how they meet the conditions to satisfy us that they are suitable to be authorised. They have all been operating under interim permissions since the transfer of consumer credit regulation in April 2014.
Our detailed assessment of the complex business models operated by each firm has been important to ensure consumers are not being put at risk and that adequate consumer protections are in place.  We will ensure that firms are meeting the right standards before they are fully authorised. 
Of the three largest firms in the sector, Buy As You View has now entered administration, Perfect Home was authorised in December 2017, and BrightHouse is working towards meeting the conditions as set out in the Minded to Authorise letter issued in April 2017.
Our supervisory interventions have been targeting poor practice to tackle the more immediate concerns we have had with rent-to-own since the transfer of consumer credit regulation in 2014. In November 2016 we announced our review into High-Cost Credit.  This review is looking at any rules that could be changed or introduced on a number of high-cost credit products; including rent-to-own. We published an update on this work on 31 January 2018. 
This update highlights our continuing policy work across consumer credit and also examines how the FCA and others could support the growth of alternative credit.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

FCA urges action on interest-only mortgages,Press Releases,30/01/2018,30/01/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-urges-action-on-interest-only-mortgages,"Nearly one in five mortgage customers have an interest-only mortgage and the FCA is concerned that shortfalls in repayment plans could lead to people losing their homes.
As part of its thematic review into the fair treatment of existing interest-only mortgage customers the FCA found that, although mortgage lenders are writing to customers prior to their mortgage maturing, engagement rates with firms are low.
The FCA review covered 10 lenders who represent around 60% of the interest-only residential mortgage market and looked at how lenders are treating these customers to help ensure their mortgages are repaid at maturity. 
Jonathan Davidson, Executive Director of Supervision – Retail & Authorisations, said:
“Since 2013 good progress has been made in reducing the number of people with interest-only mortgages. However, we are very concerned that a significant number of interest-only customers may not be able to repay the capital at the end of the mortgage and be at risk of losing their homes.'
“We know that many customers remain reluctant to contact their lender to discuss their interest-only mortgage for a variety of reasons.  We are very clear that people should talk to their lender as early as possible as this will give them more options when it comes to the next steps they can take.'
“We are encouraged to see that lenders have taken positive steps to engage with and help their interest-only customers. However, as the number of maturities start to increase towards 2032, it is important that lenders take time to review and, where possible, improve, their own strategies.'
There are currently 1.67m full interest-only and part capital repayment mortgage accounts outstanding in the UK. They represent 17.6% of all outstanding mortgage accounts and over the next few years increasing numbers will require repayment (see notes for editors).
The FCA found that lenders are actively trying to communicate with their customers to understand repayment strategies and to provide appropriate and affordable solutions where needed. However, for most lenders, the engagement is based on writing to customers at specific times before maturity. Where lenders tailored their work to the different customer types identified, they were able to increase contact with those considered higher risk.
The FCA also found that, although lenders were recommending repayment options that appeared appropriate for those customers who made contact and that the harm of repossession due to non-repayment was reduced, the processes which customers had to follow were, on many occasions, challenging. This included delays in getting to speak to advisers, making multiple phone calls and repeating information previously provided.
In 2013 the FCA identified three residential interest-only mortgage maturity peaks. The first peak, happening now, is likely to have more modest shortfalls due to the profile of customers typically being those who are approaching retirement with higher incomes, assets and levels of forecast equity in their property at the end of term. The next two peaks in 2027/2028 and 2032 include less affluent individuals who had higher income multiples at the point of application, greater rates of mortgages converted from repayment to interest-only and lower forecast equity levels; the FCA is concerned that they are more at risk of shortfalls. 
Alongside the thematic review the FCA has also published consumer research about why customers are failing to talk to their lender about their interest-only mortgage. This is aimed at assisting lenders in building a greater understanding of why customers may not be making contact.
A leaflet highlighting the benefits to customers of talking to their lender as early as possible has also been released.
Notes to editors
Read the review: TR18/1.
Review the 2013 guidance: FG13/7.
The FCA commissioned Kantar Public to conduct customer research to understand why some customers are not engaging with their lender about their interest-only mortgage. The findings of Kantar Public’s customer research will also be published today.

The FCA is due to publish an interim Mortgage Market Study in 2018.
The FCA published a quarterly consultation paper in September 2017 which includes retirement interest-only mortgages.
The FCA’s Financial Lives 2017 research identified that 70% of all interest-only and part capital repayment mortgages are held by customers aged over 45. The FCA published its Financial Lives survey in October 2017.
The FCA published a news story in 2013, which provided information and links to other sites to help interest-only customers.
This review looked at the management of the interest-only “back book' and has not considered new mortgages arranged since the introduction of new rules following the Mortgage Market Review (MMR) in April 2014.
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).

Building cyber resilience,Speeches,26/01/2018,26/01/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/building-cyber-resilience,"Speaker: Robin Jones, Head of Technology, Resilience & CyberEvent: PIMFA Financial Crime Conference, LondonDelivered: 25 JanuaryNote: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version
Highlights
It is vital that firms protect their critical information, detect attempts to breach these protective controls and respond quickly and effectively.
We do not operate in a zero failure environment and cyber-attacks will actively adapt to defensive controls.
Resilience is key. Build effective cyber capability, implement effective accountability, and be prepared and able to enter recovery at any time.
Put the foundational elements in place, help your people to be secure and implement effective governance.
Technological innovations transform how we live. Think of the internal combustion engine – first patented in 1794. This led to the first cars in the mid-1880s; the Wright Brothers aeroplane in 1903; and the first liquid fuelled rocket in 1939. This technology made transport more efficient. We have revolutionised how we connect people and can even see our planet from space. But with new innovation comes new risks. We have learned new behaviours to manage these risks.
In 2017 we had 69 material attacks reported to us, an increase on the 38 last year and 24 the year before.
Turning now to digital innovation; the first computer was made around 1948, the World Wide Web in the 1980s and cloud computing today. These innovations connect us all to each other, to services and to data. But, as I have said, with innovation comes new risks and cyber presents a very significant risk in its scale and unpredictability, you all know this. But in the same way we have managed risks from combustion engines, we need to understand how we can minimise the harm from a cyber-attack. As set out in the government’s National Cyber Security Strategy 2016 to 2021, we need to be secure and resilient, whilst remaining prosperous and confident in a digital world.
In the last 3 years there have been significant data thefts or systems crippled by ransomware. Well publicised examples include:
SONY
Talk talk
Wannacry
Equifax
In the past 12 months, the National Cyber Security Centre recorded over 1100 reported attacks, with 590 regarded as significant. 30 of these required action by government bodies, a number of which included the Financial Sector. In real terms, the UK deals with more than 10 significant cyber-attacks every week. In 2017 we had 69 material attacks reported to us, an increase on the 38 last year and 24 the year before. Recent ONS statistics show about 1.9 million incidents of fraud were cyber related.
The personal problem
Today we are seeing individuals and criminal groups developing tools and exploiting vulnerabilities on an industrial scale. And with the speed of data processing and interconnectedness of systems, attacks travel fast.
In June 2017, still raw from the unprecedented global events caused by WannaCry, the world saw a second attack; NotPetya. This attack was designed to spread fast and cause maximum damage to companies of all sizes, using the powerful Petya malware code combined with leaked NSA exploits. For those that patched the vulnerabilities identified by Wannacry the attack was contained quickly.
The NotPetya malware was designed to use a collection of tools to infect machines and travel through a network as rapidly as possible. One report put the time of total failure of one of the largest victims of the NotPetya attack, with almost 10,000 connected systems, at just 19 minutes.
What do we expect to see?
If your firm had 19 minutes where would you start? Consider that this was the time it took to infect 10,000 systems. Is your estate smaller? If it is, then you should reduce the amount of time; so now you have even less time to react. Where would you start with less time?
In a digital world, as a regulator we care about resilience.  Our vision of resilience is that firms can protect themselves from many attacks, identify threats, and vulnerabilities. But we know attacks will happen.  Therefore, firms should be able to detect attacks that are successful and know how to respond to and recover: to contain any disruption, restore lost service or protect vital data - quickly.
Firms should be able to detect attacks that are successful and know how to respond to and recover.
These are the basic principles of cyber resilience. How firms achieve these basic principles will depend on what is appropriate for each business, its customers and suppliers. Our ambition is to raise awareness and the capability of the firms we regulate to have good cyber hygiene, a good security culture and good governance. We want you to be as secure and resilient as you can be and we recognise that this will mean different things to different sizes and business models of firms we regulate.
What do we want you to do?
You need to have an understanding of your key assets and be constantly assessing where they are vulnerable. If you only had 19 minutes, what would you need to protect the most? A firm which understands what its critical assets are - and their back up arrangements - is much better informed to protect those assets than one that does not. And for data theft, the focus is on knowing what is important and protecting that and your customers from its theft. Many attackers have exploited the simplest and oldest vulnerabilities, so addressing basic hygiene factors such as vulnerabilities in old systems or patching on a regular cycle is important.
But it’s not just about technology: people can often be the weakest link. We have said previously that staff awareness is a vital element of protection – e.g. to spot phishing emails, ensure password disciplines and data controls are maintained. And what about your suppliers? Who has access to your systems? Do they need it? Change passwords regularly, manage access to your systems and classify your data; these are a few of the ways that you can build layers of resilience to create a good security culture with all your staff.
All of these mean putting strong governance in place and having visible leadership.
It is critical that business leaders understand what a cyber-attack could do, how to respond and recover. We understand this makes demands of already busy senior leaders. But we think it is important this is no longer confined to the technology department. It needs to move into the Board room. It needs to be understood as a significant risk to the operation of a business, its consumers and wider markets.
We can all think of businesses which have suffered from high profile cyber-attacks in the last 12 months. We can learn some key lessons from the cyber-attacks that have already happened. 
The first lesson is addressing the basics. As I have already said, attacks often exploit well-known vulnerabilities. When the National Audit Office investigated the Wannacry incident, they found that much of the attack could have been prevented if the NHS had followed basic security best practice. 
The second lesson is to detect attacks, stop them spreading and have in place robust contingency plans. The best way to mitigate a ransomware attack is to have a back up: know and agree your organisation’s tolerance for systems or data being unavailable.
The third lesson is to ensure any contingency plan includes a communications plan. For example, know how to get hold of key people, how to contact staff and very importantly how to contact consumers and suppliers – and authorities. Too often we see firms creating these plans at the same time as dealing with the effects of an attack - juggling containment and recovery with consumer questions, press and supplier enquiries which all mount up very quickly.
I will give you an example. Last year, during a financial sector contingency planning exercise, one particular financial firm stood out. The firm had thought about lesson three – they had a clear well thought out plan and they executed it effectively.  They had thought ahead of time what their customers may need in the event of an attack: for example what to do or where to go. Indeed it became so apparent that others participating in the same exercise began to do the same and quickly updated their customer communications through their websites and other media outlets. Response and recovery require thought out plans in advance which have been practiced and tested – they should not be created as the incident unfolds.
Our agenda
From a FCA supervision perspective, we use a risk-based approach, concentrating our biggest effort on those firms with the potential to cause biggest harm to both consumers and markets.
We have recently carried out assessments across many of the sectors we regulate and have seen the following areas where firms could improve: focusing on basic hygiene, being better at identifying their critical assets including data, improving detection of attacks (e.g. using monitoring software). There also needs to be a focus on security culture amongst all staff e.g. training and awareness and raising levels of understanding at Board level. If you can improve in these areas, you will build a more resilient foundation focused on the right security controls on the right systems and data, and you will be able to spot abnormal activity so that your staff become part of your system of protection.
As a supervisor of 56,000 firms we have actively sought to support smaller firms as we will not be able to review in detail the resilience of whole sector. That is why we have published an infographic, in partnership with HMT, Bank of England, Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). This gives information about basic cyber hygiene and what to do if there is an attack including who to contact. For example smaller firms can use NCSC’s Cyber Essentials accreditation and connect to the Cyber Information Sharing Partnership (CISP) run by the NCSC. We plan further such communications during this year as we are passionate about increasing awareness and resilience across the financial sector. We consider this infographic to be of particular relevance to some of our smaller organisations.
We continue to work very closely with other financial authorities and the NCSC. Our work with the Bank of England and Prudential Regulation Authority continues, the first round of CBEST testing is complete and we are working together on the evolution of CBEST. Our work with the NCSC provides us with wider industry engagement, using the significant amount of material available to support firms of any size and providing guidance on best practice in cyber resilience. If you don’t already, I encourage you to use these resources.
We have also introduced cyber co-ordination groups across different financial sectors with over 175 firms participating on a quarterly basis. Firms share information about cyber experiences to help promote understanding and increase awareness. These networks are vital in helping to stop contagion across sectors as well as providing opportunities to share thoughts and ideas. We are actively investigating ways to share the outcomes and key themes from these groups with a much wider financial sector audience, to benefit those firms who are unable to attend and provide context between the various sectors and better inform the industry.
The cyber landscape is complex and unpredictable. When attacks happen they happen fast, in just minutes
Finally, and very importantly, we want to ensure that firms know how to respond when they are attacked. We work closely with the other Financial Authorities and the NCSC to ensure that appropriate levels of support are provided for firms that require it. And that communications channels are made available for other firms to be made aware of an incident if appropriate. Of course, we do require firms to tell us promptly. We have worked with industry and with the other Financial Authorities to create the Financial Sector Incident Response Guide. This guide provides useful advice to all firms about where to seek help, what reporting responsibilities are, and how to properly respond to a cyber incident. It is freely available on CiSP and I encourage you to get a copy for your organisations.
Conclusion
The cyber landscape is complex and unpredictable.  When attacks happen they happen fast, in just minutes.  That means response and recovery are just as important as protection and detection.
At the FCA we want firms to be resilient and robust. That means you understand what to protect, how you can swiftly detect an attack, and how you can respond and recover. If you can do these you will have built a successful foundation for resilience.
Our challenge to you all is to embrace this effort. Attacks will happen, so be critical of yourselves, learn new behaviours and build resilience.
Thank you.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority
FCA publishes decision notices against One Call Insurance Services Limited and John Lawrence Radford,Press Releases,26/01/2018,26/01/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-publishes-decision-notices-against-one-call-insurance-services-limited-and-john-lawrence-radford,"A connected company to One Call, One Insurance Limited (OIL), has made a reference to the Upper Tribunal (the Tribunal) as a third party in relation to certain statements in the Decision Notices, where each party will present their case. The Tribunal will then determine the appropriate action for the FCA to take, which may or may not result in amendments to the Decision Notices. These Decision Notices are therefore provisional (so far as they refer to OIL) in light of the challenge being made in the Tribunal by OIL as a third party. The findings made in the Decision Notices also, so far as they refer to OIL, reflect the FCA’s belief as to what occurred.
The Decision Notice in respect of One Call sets out that the FCA has decided to fine One Call £684,000 and impose a restriction on One Call for 121 days from the date the Final Notice is issued, so that One Call is restricted during that period from charging renewal fees to its customers, which is anticipated to cost the firm approximately £4.6 million.
The Decision Notice in respect of Mr Radford sets out that the FCA has decided to fine Mr Radford £468,600 and to prohibit him from having any responsibility for client money and/or insurer money in relation to regulated activity in financial services. Mr Radford has agreed to settle at an early stage of the investigation and therefore qualifies for a 30% discount. Were it not for this discount, the FCA would have imposed a fine of £669,531 on Mr Radford.
In the FCA’s view, One Call failed to arrange adequate protection for its client money, breaching Principle 10 of the FCA’s Principles for Businesses and the Client Money Rules. Between January 2005 and September 2014, One Call received money, in the course of its activities as an insurance intermediary, which was client money under the Client Money Rules. One Call was therefore required to ensure it protected that client money, by complying with these requirements. In the FCA’s view, it failed to do so because firstly, it failed to appreciate that certain Terms of Business Agreements it wrote business under did not provide effective risk transfer and failed to operate its client money account in accordance with the Client Money Rules. Secondly, from 1 December 2009, One Call failed to treat funds advanced by a third party premium finance provider in respect of years two and three of an annual motor policy with a subsequent two-year renewal price guarantee as client money.
As a result, One Call inadvertently spent client money, resulting in a substantial client money deficit of £17.3 million, (which it has subsequently repaid) and exposing customers to a significant risk of loss. The FCA believes that One Call inadvertently used sums from its client money bank account to finance its own working capital requirements, make payments to directors and, indirectly, to capitalise OIL, although no allegation of wrongdoing is made against OIL.
Mr Radford was responsible for client money at One Call between January 2005 and September 2011 and personally responsible for ensuring One Call complied with regulatory requirements in this context. He was also the Chief Executive and a director of One Call.
In the FCA’s view, Mr Radford failed to carry out his responsibilities with due skill, care and diligence, in breach of Statement of Principle 6, in a number of ways. For example, he failed to keep himself informed of changes to regulatory requirements for handling client money and, when warned by One Call’s auditor that it might not be complying with such requirements, failed to investigate or ensure that One Call acted on those warnings.
The FCA also believes that Mr Radford failed to ensure that One Call established robust systems and controls for assessing whether effective risk transfer agreements with insurers were in place so that if any client money shortfalls arose as a result of One Call’s failure, insurers rather than customers would bear this risk. This meant he failed to identify that One Call had placed a small volume of insurance business under agreements which did not provide for effective risk transfer and the money in question should therefore have been treated as client money. He also failed to recognise that money under a multi-year policy should have been treated differently in different years from a client money perspective. His misunderstanding of the Client Money Rules meant that he did not ensure that One Call performed adequate client money calculations to ensure that its client money resource was at least equal to its client money requirement, leading to a significant client money deficit. The FCA therefore believes that Mr Radford also breached Statement of Principle 7, in that he did not take reasonable steps to ensure that the business of One Call for which he was responsible complied with relevant regulatory requirements and standards.
The FCA has decided that Mr Radford is not fit and proper to have any responsibility for client money or insurer money in the context of regulated financial services. This is on the basis of his lack of competence to perform such functions.
Both One Call and Mr Radford have agreed to settle at an early stage of the investigation and therefore qualified for a 30% discount. Were it not for this discount, the FCA would have decided to impose a fine of £977,147 and a restriction for a period of 182 days on One Call and a fine of £669,531 on Mr Radford.

"FCA fines Interactive Brokers (UK) Limited £1,049,412 for poor market abuse controls and failure to report suspicious client transactions",Press Releases,25/01/2018,25/01/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-interactive-brokers-uk-limited,"IBUK is an online broker based in London which arranges and executes transactions in certain financial instruments such as CFDs (contracts for difference) directly for its UK clients, and executes other products on behalf of other entities in the wider Interactive Brokers Group. 
IBUK delegated its post-trade monitoring to a team based at another company within the Interactive Brokers Group in the US. However, IBUK failed to adequately input into the design and calibration of the post-trade monitoring systems, or test their operation, to ensure that potential market abuse by its clients would be captured, and it failed to provide effective oversight of the US team’s conduct of the reviews of the reports produced. In particular, it carried out no quality assurance or monitoring of the review of the reports, and it failed to ensure that the staff conducting the reviews were adequately trained.
This heightened the risk of IBUK failing to submit suspicious transaction reports (STRs) to the FCA. Prior to being notified of the FCA’s concerns, during the Relevant Period IBUK failed to submit any STRs in relation to insider dealing and the Authority has identified three occasions on which IBUK failed to report suspicious trading by IBUK clients.
Mark Steward, Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:
'Firms not only have a key responsibility to report suspicious conduct in our capital markets, they also have an obligation to ensure their trading systems are not used for the purpose of financial crime. IBUK’s systems were inadequate and ineffective in the face of potentially suspicious transactions; they fell below the appropriate standards and exposed counterparties and the market to risks they did not bargain for. The FCA will continue to enforce appropriate standards of market conduct to ensure our markets function well.'
The FCA considers that the breach revealed serious and systemic weaknesses within IBUK’s procedures. The FCA has therefore fined IBUK £1,049,412.

Statement on communications in relation to PRIIPs,Statements,24/01/2018,24/01/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/statement-communications-relation-priips,"The PRIIPs Regulation
The Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPs) Regulation has applied from 1 January 2018. Since then, PRIIP manufacturers have been required to prepare and publish a stand-alone, standardised document, a KID, for each of their PRIIPs. Further, firms that advise a retail investor on a PRIIP, or sell a PRIIP to a retail investor, must provide the retail investor with a KID in good time before the transaction is concluded.
The KID details risks, performance scenarios, costs and other pre-contractual information in a standardised way. The KID is required to be accurate, fair, clear and not misleading. How information in the KID should be calculated is set out in the PRIIPs Regulatory Technical Standards (RTSs). Both the PRIIPs Regulation and related RTSs are directly applicable European legislation.
Our rules require firms to ensure that their communications with clients are fair, clear and not misleading (Principle 7 of the Principles for Business). They are also required to act honestly, fairly and professionally, in accordance with the best interests of their clients (the client’s best interests rule in COBS 2.1.1R).
We understand some firms are concerned that, for a minority of PRIIPs, the ‘performance scenario’ information required in the KID may appear too optimistic and so has the potential to mislead consumers. There may a number of reasons for this: the strong past performance of certain markets, the way the calculations in the RTSs must be carried out, or calculation errors.
Where a PRIIP manufacturer is concerned that performance scenarios in their KID are too optimistic, such that they may mislead investors, we are comfortable with them providing explanatory materials to put the calculation in context and to set out their concerns for investors to consider.
Where firms selling or advising on PRIIPs have concerns that the performance scenarios in a particular KID may mislead their clients, they should consider how to address this, for example by providing additional explanation as part of their communications with clients.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Financial Conduct Authority consults on widening access to the Financial Ombudsman Service for small businesses,Press Releases,22/01/2018,22/01/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/financial-conduct-authority-consults-widening-access-financial-ombudsman-service-small-businesses,"At the moment only individual consumers and around 5.5 million micro-enterprises (the smallest type of business) can access the Ombudsman if they have a dispute with a financial services firm. Businesses that cannot access the Ombudsman would need to take the firm to court. However, the FCA believes that many smaller businesses within this group struggle to do so in practice.
Under the changes proposed by the FCA, approximately 160,000 additional SMEs, charities and trusts would be able to refer complaints to the Ombudsman. This would be done by changing the eligibility criteria to access the Ombudsman, so businesses with fewer than 50 employees, annual turnover below £6.5 million and an annual balance sheet (i.e. gross assets) below £5 million would become eligible.
As long as a complainant is eligible, the Ombudsman can consider complaints about any regulated activity; it can also consider complaints about some unregulated activities, such as, lending to companies or the activities of business turnaround units.
The FCA also proposes to extend eligibility to personal guarantors of corporate loans, provided the borrowing business also meets the eligibility criteria.
Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive at the FCA, said:
'It is important for everyone, including financial services firms, that there is an effective dispute resolution mechanism for businesses. Our evidence suggests some small businesses currently find it hard to achieve a fair outcome in disputes with financial services firms because court action is not a realistic option for them.  We have considered what could be done within our powers and the remit of the Financial Ombudsman Service to improve this situation and are proposing to expand access to the Ombudsman.'
The FCA proposals focus on the Financial Ombudsman Service because of its expertise in the financial services sector and the FCA’s statutory role in relation to it. More material changes, such as changing the basis for the way the Ombudsman makes decisions to enable it to deal with significantly higher value disputes, would require legislation, which only the Government can introduce. 
The FCA is asking for responses to the consultation by 22 April 2018 and intends to publish a Policy Statement making final rules in summer 2018.

CP18/3: Consultation on SME access to the Financial Ombudsman Service and Feedback to DP15/7: SMEs as Users of Financial Services
The FCA’s Discussion Paper 15/7: Our approach to SMEs as users of financial services
In April 2017, the FCA launched a consultation on its future mission. We have published a summary of the responses we received in this feedback document which committed to publishing a formal consultation and feedback statement on SMEs’ access to redress.
Currently businesses with 10 or more employees and annual turnover or annual balance sheet (i.e. gross assets) above €2m, cannot refer complaints to the Ombudsman. Charities with income over £1m and trusts with net assets above £1m are also ineligible.
Alongside small businesses, we are proposing to make charities with income up to £6.5m and trusts with net assets up to £5m eligible to refer complaints to the Ombudsman.
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

Introduction: Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive and Anne Richards, Chair, FCA Practitioner Panel
Welcome to the January edition of Regulation round-up. 
A random sample of 12,000 firms are being invited to take part in the 2018 joint FCA and Practitioner Panel survey. Look out for an email from Kantar Public inviting you to take part. 
Kantar Public is an independent social research organisation, carrying out the survey on our behalf. If you’re invited to complete the survey, please take the time to fill it in. Your views will be valuable in helping to shape the FCA’s approach. The results are presented to the Practitioner Panel and the FCA Board and will be published in the third quarter of 2018. 
We carry out the survey among businesses across the sectors of the financial services industry. The results give the FCA Board and Executive valuable feedback on how the organisation is performing and how it can improve. 
Last year’s survey highlighted several key areas for improvement. These included:
more transparency and predictability of regulation
better communications on EU withdrawal
improving the perception of the quality of policy and technical staff 
As a result of last year’s survey, we have committed to addressing all these areas. Further details can be found in the Mission and Business Plan. The findings of this year’s survey will be an important input to future work. 
You can find out more about the survey and last year’s results on the FCA website and more about the Practitioner Panel on the Panel website.

Revised Payments Services Directive - PSD2 Goes Live!
The Revised Payments Services Directive (PSD2) came into effect in the UK this Saturday, 13 January. 
PSD2 is an EU Directive which aims to increase competition, bring into scope new types of payment services and enhance customer protection. 
There will be wide-reaching implications for a range of firms including banks, other Payment Service Providers, Financial Technology companies and customers. 
For more information about PSD2 and how your firm may be affected see the FCA website.
Consumer Mis-direction
We need your help, to reduce a high number of calls from consumers responding to letters, emails or sales literature they have received from regulated firms.
Consumers call us believing we are the firm, as our number is on the firm’s website and marketing materials. This causes a poor consumer experience, as they have to re-dial to speak to the firm.
Answering these calls delays us in helping other consumers, some of whom are vulnerable. We have spoken to the firms who were generating the most calls to us and found that removing our phone number dramatically reduces the calls.
Please review your use of the FCA’s details on your website, emails and sales literature and remove our phone number. There is no regulatory requirement for you to give the FCA’s phone number. Removing it may improve your customers’ experience. For full details of what your status disclosure should be, please refer to Chapter 4 of our General Provisions Sourcebook. 
The Contact Centre operates as the FCA’s public face, providing information and guidance to regulated firms, to people setting up businesses and to consumers, through a variety of communication channels. 
Operating as part of the Contact Centre, the Consumer Helpline offers guidance to consumers on a broad range of queries about financial services and products, from register checks to complex investment cases.

Dear CEO: Contracts for Difference
We have sent a Dear CEO letter to firms that provide or distribute contracts for difference (CFD) products to retail customers on an advisory or discretionary basis to ensure they understand their obligations. This letter follows the conclusion of a project that assessed whether CFD providers and distributors deliver the CFD product to the intended target market, pay due regard to the interests of customers and treat them fairly. 
We expect CFD firms to consider the issues raised and take action to ensure compliance if any areas of concern are identified.

Under the FCA handbook Core Sup 15.5 all firms have a regulatory requirement to keep their contact information up to date.
To avoid missing important information that could affect your firm make sure your email address, phone number and address are all correct and up to date on the FCA system. 
You can change or update your contact information by using our online system for notifications and applications, Connect.

Following the introduction of the EU Payment Services Directive (PSD2) on 13 January 2018, online services that customers allow to access their account data or make payments on their behalf will be regulated by the FCA. 
PSD2 will bring about a number of important changes for your members and the customers that use their services. To support these changes we have produced a web page setting out information we think customers should be aware of when using newly regulated services. 
This information will be helpful to promote consistency of messaging to consumers across different parts of the industry.

FCA issues list of unauthorised binary options providers,Press Releases,12/01/2018,12/01/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-issues-list-unauthorised-binary-options-providers,"Since January 3rd 2018, firms involved in binary options trading in the UK have been required to be authorised by the FCA. Firms that are not authorised by the FCA and continue with binary options activities beyond that date will be acting in breach of section 19 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA), which is a criminal offence.
This list is based upon information that the FCA has received from consumers, partner agencies and from monitoring the binary options market. Many of these firms claim to be based in the UK but the FCA believes that most of the addresses they provide are false and that the firms are actually based overseas.
The FCA is examining each of these firms to determine whether any are genuinely operating from within the UK. If they are, the FCA will consider taking enforcement action through the courts to stop their illegal activity.
Binary option consumers typically lose money, and these losses can be significant. Any consumers who trade with an unauthorised binary options firm will not have access to the the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme should things go wrong. Firms that are authorised to offer binary options to UK consumers are listed on the FCA’s register.

"FCA fines and bans former RBS trader, Neil Danziger",Press Releases,08/01/2018,08/01/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-and-bans-former-rbs-trader-neil-danziger,"Mr Danziger formerly worked at RBS trading products referenced to Japanese Yen (JPY) LIBOR. In addition, on occasion, he made RBS’s JPY LIBOR submissions to the British Bankers Association (BBA) when RBS’s primary submitters were not available. 
The FCA has found that Mr Danziger was knowingly concerned in RBS’s failure to observe proper standards of market conduct and has determined that he is not a fit and proper person because he acted recklessly and lacks integrity.
Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA said:
“Proper standards of market conduct reflect the interests of the whole community in the well-being of our financial markets.  Mr Danziger’s reckless disregard of these standards has no place in the financial services industry.  Market participants cannot turn a blind eye to what the community, through its laws and regulations, expects nor apply their own, lower standards. This substantial fine and ban should reinforce that message.'
The FCA found that between 14 February 2007 and 22 November 2010, Mr Danziger:
routinely made requests to RBS’s primary submitters, intending to benefit the trading positions for which he and other derivatives traders were responsible;
took those trading positions into account when acting as a substitute submitter;
on two occasions, obtained a broker’s assistance to attempt to manipulate the JPY LIBOR submissions of other banks.
In addition, between 19 September 2008 and 25 August 2009, Mr Danziger entered into 28 wash trades – risk free trades, with the same party, in pairs that cancelled each other out and for which there was no legitimate commercial rationale. The purpose of these wash trades was to make or facilitate brokerage payments to two firms of brokers in recognition of his receipt of personal hospitality.
The FCA found he acted recklessly, and therefore with a lack of integrity, in deliberately closing his mind to the risk that his actions were improper.
On 18 June 2014, the FCA issued Mr Danziger with a Warning Notice, but proceedings were stayed due to the ongoing criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into certain individuals who formerly worked at RBS. Today’s fine and ban reflect the FCA’s commitment to protect the integrity of the UK financial system. 
Notes to editors:
The Final Notice for Neil Danziger.
The Final Notice for RBS.

On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

FCA confirms final rules on improving the quality of pension transfer advice,Press Releases,04/10/2018,04/10/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-confirms-final-rules-improving-quality-pension-transfer-advice,"Today the FCA has published new rules aimed at improving the advice people receive when considering transferring their pension. This policy statement confirms that the FCA is taking forward most of the proposals put forward for consultation in March 2018, which mainly related to transfers from defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution (DC) pension schemes. This consultation proposed further changes to its rules and guidance on advising on transferring from safeguarded benefit schemes (where there is some form of guarantee or promise about the rate of secure pension income that the member will receive, or will have an option to receive).
The changes include a requirement for all pension transfer specialists to hold a specific qualification for providing advice on investments by October 2020, enabling advisers to identify whether a proposed pension scheme and investment solution is consistent with the client’s needs and objectives. The FCA also expects advisers to consider their client’s attitude to, and understanding of, the risks of giving up safeguarded benefits for flexible benefits. These new rules should improve the advice that people get when considering transferring their pension, including as a result of the pension freedoms.
As part of the consultation, the FCA also sought views on whether to intervene in charging structures. This could include banning contingent charging, which is when a fee for advice is only paid when a transfer goes ahead. It also asked about the impact on access to advice due to restrictions on charging models.
Contingent charging is a complex area and the responses to the FCA’s consultation confirm its initial analysis that the evidence it has seen does not show that contingent charging is the main driver of poor outcomes for customers. The FCA’s supervisory work to date has also identified a number of other causes of poor advice, and it will carry out further work on the quality of advice.
The FCA’s work on improving the quality of pension transfer advice has been ongoing since 2015 and following our supervisory work, a number of firms have stopped providing pension transfer advice. It is also continuing to speak directly to advisers about what good and bad practice looks like at a series of Live and Local events.
Christopher Woolard, FCA's Executive Director of Strategy and Competition said:
“These new rules will mean advisers have greater certainty and confidence in what we expect when they offer pension transfer advice.
“We expect our interventions to improve the quality of advice which will help to reduce the number of complaints against advisory firms. We will measure consumer outcomes through our supervisory work.'
“Any changes to our rules on contingent charging could have implications for the supply of advice. Because of the significance of this issue to all stakeholders in the market, we will carry out further analysis and consult on new interventions if appropriate in the first half of next year.'

"Rolling the rock: The cycle of deregulation, crisis and regulation",Speeches,02/10/2018,03/10/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/rolling-rock-cycle-deregulation-crisis-and-regulation,"Speaker: Charles Randell, Chair, Financial Conduct AuthorityLocation: AFME Annual Conference, LondonDelivered on: 2 October 2018
Highlights:
The cycle of deregulation, crisis and regulation is particularly damaging.
The most important way to avoid a damaging cycle of deregulation, crisis and regulation is to keep an open mind about the shortcomings of our existing rules.
We need to have the humility and the confidence to acknowledge that we do not always know best and that our past decisions have not always been optimal.
We should try to ensure that the total programme of regulatory change is phased and coordinated in a proportionate way.
The FCA does not see the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union as an opportunity to join a race to the bottom in regulatory standards – quite the contrary.
Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version.
The Greeks know a thing or two about financial crises. So it’s fitting that Greek mythology gives us the story of Sisyphus, condemned to roll a huge boulder up a hill, only for it to roll down again before it reaches the top, repeating this action for all eternity. His sins, you may recall, were trickery and arrogance, two words which don’t – as far as I know – appear in the FCA Handbook. But perhaps they should: they are strong indicators of serious problems in a financial firm.
The myth of Sisyphus is a good metaphor for the cycle of financial deregulation, crisis and regulation that societies have gone through again and again. After each crisis, we bring in a weight of new regulation. We push it up the hill to implementation. And then we deregulate. And then a new crisis starts the process all over again.
Are we condemned to repeat this for eternity, or can we break the cycle? It’s the right time to ask this question, for two reasons.
First, the worst of the global financial crisis is now ten years behind us. I can remember what I was doing 10 years ago as if it were yesterday, in a team responding to the imminent collapse of numerous global banks. It’s not something I want to repeat, although I was one of the lucky ones.  For me, the crisis was a professional assignment, but for many people it brought personal tragedy: loss of their jobs or businesses, loss of their mental or physical health, and in some cases loss of their lives. Now some memories are beginning to fade, and there are voices calling for deregulation again.
And secondly, as the UK leaves the European Union, we may have some choices to make about exactly how to achieve the regulatory outcomes we need to continue to deliver.
Deregulation and crises
An IMF Working Paper earlier this year summarised some of the many episodes in financial history when deregulation, or liberalisation as it is sometimes called, led to a financial crisis.
The most obvious form of deregulation is when policymakers repeal existing rules. In the UK, we have seen this kind of cycle in the consumer credit world. The 1974 Consumer Credit Act – one of the most complicated pieces of legislation ever to enter the statute book - was on the one hand highly regulatory, imposing stringent new disclosure requirements, and on the other highly deregulatory, repealing the presumptive cap on interest rates. Then advertising and the internet fundamentally changed the way that some firms and consumers behaved. The rise of a group of payday lenders combining slick advertising with loose affordability criteria and excessive interest rates led to widespread consumer harm and the eventual re-imposition of a cap in 2015.
But another form of deregulation is when policymakers decide not to apply existing principles to some apparently new financial innovation because ‘this time is different’. This allows the industry to deregulate itself by diverting financial activities into new unregulated channels. As Reinhart and Rogoff show, this time isn’t different very often. The Great Recession which started in 2008 is only the most recent example of many. The political drive to make home ownership available to more Americans contributed to sub-prime lending flourishing without appropriate regulatory oversight. Loose regulation of derivatives and securitisation structures, hailed as a new way of ‘completing markets’, allowed massive amounts of leverage to enter the sub-prime market. Sub-prime lending contributed to a broader real estate bubble which inevitably burst.
The cycle of deregulation, crisis and regulation is particularly damaging not just because vulnerable people’s lives are hit much harder by financial crises than those of financial executives, politicians and regulators. Constant regulatory change can sap the confidence of the public and industry in the regulatory process. Constant regulatory change can also damage competition: the largest firms with the best lobbyists often seek to influence the process; and the bigger the firm, the bigger its economies of scale in absorbing lobbying and compliance costs. Constant regulatory change can also damage the quality and efficiency of regulation, because the changes are often patched on to the existing regulatory framework, which becomes more and more complex and less and less coherent.
Constant regulatory change can also damage the quality and efficiency of regulation, because the changes are often patched on to the existing regulatory framework, which becomes more and more complex and less and less coherent.
I would like to offer some thoughts about how we should approach our work in the future to limit, if not avoid, this damaging cycle. In doing so, I would commend (to those of you who have not already read it) the FCA Mission publication of last year, in which the FCA under Andrew Bailey’s leadership set out our blueprint for approaching our tasks. It provides a logical and robust architecture which will endure after we have left the European Union.
Keeping an open mind
I would suggest that the most important way to avoid a damaging cycle of deregulation, crisis and regulation is to keep an open mind about the shortcomings of our existing rules. Not all deregulation is undesirable. Nothing is more damaging to the cause of regulators than defending poor regulations if it’s clear that they produce perverse consequences, impose excessive costs that consumers and businesses ultimately bear and prevent innovation from which consumers and businesses would benefit.
We undoubtedly have plenty to do to continuously improve our existing rules and the way we supervise, keeping pace with the opportunities that new technology and new insights offer us and with the way that the financial services industry itself is innovating and evolving.
But given the risk that our rulebook becomes a patchwork, we also need to stand back and take a fresh look from time to time to ensure its overall coherence and consistency. That’s why the FCA has committed to a review of its Handbook as part of the Mission and will take this forward when the time is right, once the post-Brexit landscape is clear and we and the firms we regulate have absorbed any changes resulting from leaving the EU.
As Chair of the FCA, I am struck by the fact that both consumer and industry representatives have many of the same complaints about regulation. For example, they have the same complaints about customer onboarding procedures, disclosures and paperwork requirements. At the same time, behavioural scientists have found that personalised, targeted explanations of key facts to consumers are far more effective at promoting their engagement with financial decisions than disclosing everything there is to know about them in a bewildering sheaf of paperwork.
So I can’t defend all our current requirements and I shouldn’t. As technology changes and as we learn more about shifts in consumer behaviour, we should keep an open mind about the best ways to achieve the outcomes we want. There’s a lot we can do to look at how our rules are working in practice and listen to those who bear the brunt of them – the users and providers of financial services.
So I can’t defend all our current requirements and I shouldn’t. As technology changes and as we learn more about shifts in consumer behaviour, we should keep an open mind about the best ways to achieve the outcomes we want.
As we go about this, we have a great asset: the insight that we get from our independent expert panels and the stakeholder feedback that we receive directly from consumers, businesses and industry professionals in Europe’s largest financial market. So in considering how to improve existing regulations, we need to continue to make full use of this asset, which is a huge comparative advantage of UK financial regulation.
We also need to have the humility and the confidence to acknowledge that we do not always know best and that our past decisions have not always been optimal. Last month the FCA published its first ex post evaluation of the impact of our interventions in the guaranteed asset protection insurance market. We found that our interventions had had a positive overall impact, including significant savings to consumers, but they had less impact in some areas than expected. We can learn a lot from this type of exercise when designing future remedies; and it also makes clear that the best-intended regulation may not deliver all the promised benefits. Ex post evaluation papers will be an important, transparent part of our regulatory toolbox, giving us evidence of where we may need to change tack.
Less can be more
It isn’t possible to generalise about regulation and deregulation. In some areas – such as the area of disclosures and paperwork that I’ve mentioned – we may need different, smarter regulation that’s better at producing the outcomes we want; in other areas we may simply need to use different tools. In that sense, less can sometimes be more.
The FCA has committed in its Mission to choosing the right tools to deal with the harms it sees. Our policy tool – making new rules – is just one of the tools in our toolkit. Sometimes more supervision of compliance with existing rules, and crucially, focussing on outcomes and principles can be a better response; or using our competition or enforcement powers.
Just as governments can tend to prioritise legislation over delivery, regulators can tend to prioritise rulemaking. So we need to make sure that we don’t reach for the rulemaking tool when it isn’t the best response.
Timing and coordination
In a similar vein, there’s a good case for re-examining the way in which multiple and sometimes competing regulatory demands hit participants in the financial sector, often at the same time. Even where only one regulator is involved, there is the risk that the phasing and impact of separate regulatory initiatives won’t be coordinated.
We do not want regulatory changes to inadvertently heighten the risk of operational failures. Firms have finite resources to meet regulatory change demands as well as the need to adapt their businesses in a world of changing consumer expectations and business models. Smaller firms in particular have a more limited ability to respond to our consultations and policy changes, so we need to ensure that our communications and timetables take their needs into account.
That’s not to say that we should go soft on the industry. But we must be guided by the objectives and the principles of good regulation set out in our statute. So we should try to ensure that the total programme of regulatory change is phased and coordinated in a proportionate way.
Evidence based regulation
A strong safeguard against unjustified regulation (and deregulation) is to insist on the sound use of evidence to evaluate policy decisions.
This is an area which is developing fast.
The FCA has for some time been subject to various requirements to conduct cost-benefit analysis and it has very recently published an up to date statement on how it approaches such analysis. However, it’s important to acknowledge that cost-benefit analysis alone can never fully answer questions about whether to regulate or deregulate.
It tends to be narrowly focused on the implementation of one discrete new policy; it may sometimes rest on assumptions which can be contested; and in particular there is always the risk that regulators underestimate the costs of regulation, which are often passed on to consumers. Furthermore, as John Cochrane has said:
‘The biggest costs are unseen: the businesses that didn’t get started, the people that didn’t get hired by those businesses, the innovative financial products that didn’t get innovated, the better lives their consumers would have lived, the improved savings and investment vehicles that would have cushioned risks and improved people’s lives in their old age, the economic growth that didn’t happen.’
These costs are inherently difficult to estimate.
Moreover, conduct regulation is often about quite specific distributional questions rather than overall macroeconomic impacts. One person’s benefit can be another’s cost. Is it better for 100 people to have more access to high cost credit, if 85 of them use it productively and repay, 15 of them suffer mental or physical health problems as a result, and 2 of those end up homeless? How can you possibly put a price on each of these consequences?
We also need to look at these questions through the lens of real world impacts on individual consumers rather than economic aggregates. So the FCA has been leading the way among financial regulators in extending its evidence base into the area of real world consumer behaviour. As we move towards a world of ever bigger data and a greater capability to understand it, we may gain further insights.
And we need to be honest about the extent to which our regulation is based on judgments about social policy choices rather than quantitative evidence about cost and benefit.
Regulatory independence
Some of these social choices should be made by elected politicians, not unelected regulators. However, regulators have a critical role to play in giving independent advice on proposed policy changes and drawing attention to the inadequacies of existing policies.
So we need to continue to make sure that we maintain robust governance structures and diverse governing bodies, to secure our independence.
So we need to continue to make sure that we maintain robust governance structures and diverse governing bodies, to secure our independence.
But we must acknowledge that there are a number of problems in our society we can’t solve through FCA rules. There are pressing social issues such as the cost of housing, low financial resilience in general and unsustainable personal debt in particular, and inadequate saving for retirement and care in later life. Solving these issues extends well beyond financial regulation. We need to continue to speak up about the limits of what we can and should seek to achieve by ourselves.
And where new areas of financial activity emerge, we need to be able to draw attention to gaps in protection which may require lawmakers to act. That’s why the FCA has committed to publishing an annual statement about so-called ‘perimeter issues’.
Competitiveness
It’s often been argued that regulators should have a competitiveness objective. The FCA has an objective of promoting competition, but those who argue for a competitiveness objective want something a little different. They particularly want UK financial regulators to have a duty to ensure that the UK financial services industry can be internationally competitive.
This could imply that UK regulation would be set to a lesser extent than today by the public interest - the needs of UK consumers and businesses - and to a greater extent by the interests of the financial services industry or by decisions taken by policymakers in other jurisdictions. It could also imply some very difficult trade-offs with our other objectives: how much loss of competition should we tolerate to ensure that a sector is competitive? How much loss of consumer protection? How much loss of market integrity?
I believe that if we deliver our existing statutory objectives of making our markets work well, consumer protection, competition and market integrity, then there should be nothing to stop the firms we regulate from making money and growing in global markets. In fact, our standards of regulation should support the confidence that global clients and overseas regulators can have in the firms we authorise.
But that’s not to say that we ignore competitiveness. In fact, we already consider the recommendations we receive from the Government in their remit letter, which currently sets out the Government’s commitment to UK financial services being effectively regulated; securing the right balance between a financial sector that is globally competitive, works for consumers, and is secure over the long-term. We also consider the costs of our regulation through cost-benefit analysis, and ex post evaluation, and these costs should include the costs to the economy which would result from a less competitive industry.
We have shown how we can pursue our objectives in a way which also supports growth and competitiveness through Innovate and the Sandbox, and in the way we have approached the authorisation of new banks. We should continue to consider where we can bring similar approaches to bear in support of our objectives.
International engagement
Finally, the date for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union draws ever nearer. The agreement covering the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union and the framework for our future economic partnership will both have important implications for the way we approach our regulatory tasks in the future.
That’s why I believe that consumers and businesses across Europe will expect to have continued access to the best financial services that are available in their time zone, maximising their own welfare and the potential of their nations’ economies.
The FCA does not see the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union as an opportunity to join a race to the bottom in regulatory standards – quite the contrary. We will need to redouble our engagement with our policymaking and regulatory colleagues in Europe and across the world, to continue to influence global standards of financial regulation. As last week’s IRSG Report on Global Regulatory Coherence within Financial Services rightly emphasises, strong global standards dampen the cycle of deregulation, crisis and regulation because they reduce the opportunity for individual jurisdictions to race to the bottom, and for firms to engage in regulatory arbitrage. Strong global standards also reinforce the competitiveness of the UK financial services sector.
This is most definitely not a zero sum game. Open and consistently regulated financial markets bring benefits to consumers and businesses in all jurisdictions. That’s why I believe that consumers and businesses across Europe will expect to have continued access to the best financial services that are available in their time zone, maximising their own welfare and the potential of their nations’ economies.
Conclusion
We remain committed to high standards of regulation in the UK and to contributing to high global standards. Consumers and businesses need high quality, stable and predictable regulation. The cycle of deregulation, crisis and regulation is damaging in so many ways.

FCA fines Tesco Bank £16.4m for failures in 2016 cyber attack,Press Releases,01/10/2018,01/10/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-tesco-bank-failures-2016-cyber-attack,"Cyber attackers exploited deficiencies in Tesco Bank’s design of its debit card, its financial crime controls and in its Financial Crime Operations Team to carry out the attack. Those deficiencies left Tesco Bank’s personal current account holders vulnerable to a largely avoidable incident that occurred over 48 hours and which netted the cyber attackers £2.26m.
Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:
'The fine the FCA imposed on Tesco Bank today reflects the fact that the FCA has no tolerance for banks that fail to protect customers from foreseeable risks. In this case, the attack was the subject of a very specific warning that Tesco Bank did not properly address until after the attack started. This was too little, too late. Customers should not have been exposed to the risk at all. 
'Banks must ensure that their financial crime systems and the individuals who design and operate them work to substantially reduce the risk of such attacks occurring in the first place. The standard is one of resilience, reducing the risk of a successful cyber attack occurring in the first place, not only reacting to an attack. Subsequently, Tesco Bank has strengthened its controls with the object of preventing this type of incident from being repeated.'
Principle 2 requires a firm to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence. Tesco Bank is in the business of banking and fundamental to that business is protecting its customers from financial crime. 
The FCA found that Tesco Bank breached Principle 2 because it failed to exercise due skill, care and diligence to:
Design and distribute its debit card.
Configure specific authentication and fraud detection rules.
Take appropriate action to prevent the foreseeable risk of fraud.
Respond to the November 2016 cyber attack with sufficient rigour, skill and urgency. 
Cyber security requires resilience. A financial institution’s board is ultimately responsible for ensuring that its cyber crime controls are designed to meet standards of resilience. The board must set an appropriate cyber crime risk appetite and ensure that its institution’s cyber-crime controls are designed to anticipate and reduce the risk of a successful attack. Where an attack is successful, the board should ensure that the bank’s response plans are clear, well designed and well-rehearsed and that the bank recovers quickly from the incident.  Following an attack the financial institution should commission a root cause analysis and understand and ameliorate the vulnerabilities that made the institution susceptible to the attack to reduce the risk of future attacks.
Following the attack, Tesco Bank immediately put in place a comprehensive redress programme and devoted significant resources to improving the deficiencies that left the bank vulnerable to the attack and instituted a comprehensive review of its financial crime controls. It has made significant improvements both to enhance its financial crime systems and controls and the skills of the individuals who operate them.
Tesco Bank provided a high level of cooperation to the FCA. Through a combination of this level of cooperation, its comprehensive redress programme which fully compensated customers, and in acknowledgment that it stopped a significant percentage of unauthorised transactions, the FCA granted the bank 30% credit for mitigation. In addition, Tesco Bank agreed to an early settlement of this matter which qualified for a 30% (Stage 1) discount under the FCA’s executive settlement procedure. But for the mitigation credit and the Stage 1 discount, the FCA would have imposed a penalty of £33,562,400.
Notes to editors
The Final Notice for Tesco Personal Finance plc.
The FCA, Prudential Regulation Authority and Bank of England published a joint discussion paper, Building the UK financial sector’s operational resilience (July 2018).  The discussion paper emphasises their focus on operational resilience.   Following the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England, the DP provides notes that: Effective resilience requires firms to be able to: prevent material incidents from occurring; continue to provide services and functions in the event of an incident; prevent an increase in the level of fraud during an incident; return to normal operations promptly when the incident is over; and learn from incidents, in order to limit the chances of them happening again in future. Firms have primary responsibility for their ability to resist and recover from cyber incidents. The supervisory authorities expect boards to take responsibility for the cyber resilience of their firms'.  DP18/4: Building the UK financial sector’s operational resilience
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this, it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

"Prisoners, wellness programmes and the rats of Hanoi: why the FCA tests its interventions",Speeches,01/10/2018,01/10/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/prisoners-wellness-programmes-and-rats-hanoi-why-fca-tests-its-interventions,"Speaker: Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy and CompetitionLocation: UKCN conference, LondonDelivered on: 1st October 2018
Highlights:
The FCA has been at the forefront of recognising the value of testing interventions and was one of the first global regulators to set up a dedicated behavioural economics team.
Testing helps us design better, more effective regulation by showing what works, and what doesn’t.
The FCA has worked closely with practitioners and fellow regulators to share knowledge and design best practice.
Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version.
I’m going to give you a series of real problems. Consider the solutions and decide if you think they’re going to work. Do employee wellness programmes, which typically offer health screenings and access to weight-loss programmes or gyms, make people healthier? Does sending children who are at risk of offending to hear from prisoners put them back on the straight and narrow? And did paying villagers a bounty for catching rats and producing their tails as proof reduce Hanoi’s rat problem? The answer? None of these programmes worked.
Early evidence appeared to show that employee wellness programmes increase health. But because these studies compared those who participated against those who chose not to, all of the differences observed were simply due to self-selection. In fact, wellness programmes don’t improve health. 
Sending children to visit prisoners and learn about life on the inside actually increased offending. This was demonstrated in a famous policy failure called Scared Straight. 
And the rat population of Hanoi? Enterprising citizens found that they could cut the tails off rats in exchange for money – and then release them back into the sewers. There they would produce offspring whose tails could also be chopped off for profit!
The consequences of our policies and actions are not always easy to predict. These stories show us that even well-intentioned, well-designed interventions can fail. And we may not know this in advance.
So the first thing that we must recognise is that regulators and policymakers are fallible. Lots of us are probably aware of behavioural biases, like the tendency to favour the present over the future. And we know that this means that consumers may make poorer choices. But we, too, are human. Whether we are trying to increase switching in the savings market or encourage consumers to compare mobile phone deals, policymakers must recognise the limitations of our ability to predict the future – in particular, to predict how firms and consumers might respond to our actions. Fortunately, there is a solution. From energy regulators to water companies, policymakers have learnt the benefits of testing interventions before implementing them. In addition to more formal consultation, testing reduces uncertainty about what will work and gives us insight about how markets might respond.
The FCA has been at the forefront of recognising this. We are one of the first global regulators to set up a dedicated behavioural economics team which investigates how consumers might respond to our interventions and rigorously tests different theories. We have tested demand-side remedies in the savings market, in general insurance, in current accounts and in payday lending to name just a few. 
our testing has shown us when interventions work, and more importantly, when they don’t
We have done this in partnership with firms, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and others. And our testing has shown us when interventions work, and more importantly, when they don’t. 
For example, extensive testing of letters, texts and emails in the cash savings market showed us that the impact of disclosure remedies on switching is still small and that we need to explore stronger measures. We are now considering alternative remedies such as the introduction of a basic savings rate to help longstanding customers. This would be a variable interest rate set by each firm which would apply to all easy access cash savings accounts and easy access cash ISAs after they have been open for a set period of time. This is just one example of how testing can help us avoid the costs and wasted opportunity of interventions that sound good in theory, but have only limited effects in practice.
And testing doesn’t have to be hard. There are methods to suit every scenario. We could do a survey, which gives us a quick and dirty state of play on how consumers are feeling. We could carry out user design research to explore the barriers preventing good outcomes. We could set up an online experiment to test how consumers might respond to different policy iterations. Or, we could run randomised controlled trials in the field which give us reliable estimates of the real-world impact and magnitude of our remedies.
Whatever the method, there are three rules of thumb to follow when testing competition remedies:
Firstly, use testing which combines diagnosis of problems and the design of remedies. This can mean using more than one method. To give one example, user design research could give us the small, but crucial details which determine whether a wellbeing programme recruits – and retains – people who would benefit. Combined with a field trial, which pits one or more interventions against the status quo, we are likely to have a better chance of finding the holy grail.
At the FCA, we did exactly this to tackle the problem of consumers unintentionally going overdrawn. Working with the CMA, we tested consumer prompts and alerts, such as text messages. We started by running user design research sessions to explore hypotheses for what makes consumers pay attention to messages. We used the results of this to decide to focus on alerts rather than prompts. We then tested text messages on real consumers in lab experiments and field trials. Our interdisciplinary approach allowed us to discover precisely which types of messages worked, and which didn’t.
This was crucial for designing the final policy. Without testing, in this case, we might have enacted policies which didn’t work. This would have created costs for industry as well as consumers.
The second piece of advice is to choose your outcomes carefully. Unless we measure the precise outcomes we are aiming for, it is easy to see success where – in fact – there is none. We learnt this recently as part of our experimental research into credit cards. We know that many people are paying more in credit card debt service costs and taking longer to pay off debt then they need to. One in four people only pay the minimum contractual amount per month. We wanted to help consumers increase their payments and pay off their debt more quickly and more cheaply.
To do this, we worked with a firm to remove the minimum payment option when customers sign up for a direct debit. The early results showed great promise. One in five consumers moved away from a minimum payment direct debit and instead chose to have a fixed payment direct debit. Six months into the trial 7 percentage points more people were paying more than the minimum. We could have stopped here and congratulated ourselves on a job well done.
But our intention was to reduce overall debt. So, did this happen?
The answer is no. Although many people made higher automatic payments, this was offset by the lower manual payments that they would otherwise have made. And while our intervention caused more people to set up a higher direct debit, it also caused some people to drop out of setting up a direct debit at all. This combination of factors meant that overall debt stayed the same.
And this is something that we would never have discovered without choosing the right measures and monitoring them over a decent amount of time.
My final rule of thumb is to pay attention to the distribution of outcomes. Policies can create winners and losers. This means that if we care about a particular subset of the population –  let’s say vulnerable people – we might want to check what happened to them, as well as what happened to the whole population. Sometimes we might even want to prioritise one group over another.
For example, this summer Ofgem published the results of its active choice, collective switching trial. This helped previously disengaged consumers to switch by giving them a straightforward method where they didn’t need to enter their existing tariff details. The trial found that over 20% of contacted customers switched energy provider during the 3-month trial, even though on average they had not switched at all in the previous 6.5 years. And it particularly helped vulnerable consumers. Twenty-four percent of switches were by participants over 75 years old and customers on the Priority Services Register were almost as likely to switch as others.
Finally, our remedies will be better if we collaborate. Regulators and practitioners are tackling many of the same problems. Often we’re aiming our remedies at the same people!  Some of our best remedy examples come from when we have worked with firms. And collaboration with bodies like the UK Competition Network has been invaluable in sharing knowledge and designing best practice, as the lessons learned paper published today shows. 
just because something sounds good in theory there’s no guarantee it will work in practice
So be it prisoners, wellness programmes or the rats of Hanoi, testing shows us that even the best-intentioned interventions can fail. Policymakers are fallible, and just because something sounds good in theory there’s no guarantee it will work in practice. That’s why we must keep testing the consequences of our interventions; to learn when they work, and more importantly, when they don’t.

FCA statement on super-complaint from Citizens Advice to the CMA on excessive prices for disengaged consumers,Statements,28/09/2018,28/09/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/super-complaint-citizens-advice-cma-excessive-prices-disengaged-consumers,"The FCA has been concerned about the issue of long-standing customers being charged more for some financial products than new customers for some time. This has informed our earlier work on cash savings and mortgages.
In the FCA’s 2018/2019 Business Plan we announced that we were looking at the pricing practices of general insurance firms. As part of that work we will launch a market study looking at how general insurance firms charge their customers for home and motor insurance. The terms of reference for this market study will be published in a few weeks’ time.
Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive of the FCA commented:
'Citizens Advice has raised a number of important issues and we will work closely with the CMA as it investigates this super-complaint.
'We expect firms to look after the interests of all customers and treat them fairly, whether they are new or long-standing. It is important to get the balance right so that existing customers do not miss out on the benefits of competition and innovation, including when they purchase or renew their general insurance products.
'The general insurance market study we have announced today will help us examine the issues we have already identified in the market in more detail.'
Notes to Editors
The super-complaint also raises concerns about competition in the mortgages and cash savings markets. The FCA has already undertaken work in both these areas looking at the treatment of long-standing customers. This includes a cash savings market study which reported in 2015, a discussion paper in July 2018 on price discrimination in the cash savings market, and a mortgages market study launched in December 2016 which published its interim report in May 2018.
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).

Financial Conduct Authority publishes Decision Notice concerning Linear Investments Limited,Press Releases,27/09/2018,27/09/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-publishes-decision-notice-linear-investments-limited,"Linear has agreed the facts set out in the Notice, as well as liability for the breaches identified. It disputes the penalty imposed and has referred the issue of penalty to the Upper Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal will determine what (if any) the appropriate action is for the FCA to take, and remit the matter to the FCA with such directions as the Tribunal considers appropriate.
Prior to August 2015, Linear had limited manual oversight of trading conducted through its Direct Market Access (DMA). When Linear’s business model changed and trading volumes increased this manual oversight did not provide adequate monitoring. Up until November 2014, Linear mistakenly believed that it could rely upon post-trade surveillance undertaken by the brokers through which it executed transactions.
The FCA makes clear in its Decision Notice that a fine of £409,300 should be imposed upon Linear for its breach of Principle 3 by failing to take reasonable care to organise and control its affairs responsibly and effectively with adequate risk management systems in relation to the detection and reporting of potential instances of market abuse between 14 January 2013 and 9 August 2015.
Linear is an authorised firm providing its clients with a range of brokerage services, including access to trade execution via electronic DMA. As with any other broker, inherent within Linear’s business was the risk that clients may commit market abuse. Linear did not appreciate the need to undertake its own separate surveillance based on information available to it and its perspective. This reliance on the broker’s surveillance was wrong.
In November 2014, Linear became aware of the need to have its own post-trade surveillance system and took steps to source and implement an automated system. However, it was not until 10 August 2015 that Linear had effective systems in place to remedy the breach.
Tackling market abuse is a priority for the FCA and firms are expected to play their part by ensuring that they are able at all times to identify and manage the market abuse risks to which they are exposed. Integral to this, firms are required to identify where there are reasonable grounds to suspect market abuse has occurred and submit reports to the FCA. Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) and Suspicious Transaction and Order Reports (STORs) are crucial intelligence for the FCA in detecting market abuse.
This is the first case to be completed under a new process introduced for partly contested cases. It allows firms or individuals under investigation to agree to certain elements of the case and contest others. This means they are still eligible for a discount of up to 30% on any penalty imposed. In this case, Linear agreed facts and liability, but contest the level of penalty set out in the Decision Notice. Without this discount, the fine would have been £584,700.

Introduction: Charles Randell, Chair
Welcome to the September issue of Regulation round-up.
A lot has been written about the 10 year anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, but I would like to add a few words of my own.  
Amid the analyses of whether the financial system is now more stable and speculation about where the next crisis could come from, I don’t want us to forget the human cost of the great recession, which vast numbers of people paid with their quality of life, their jobs, their savings, their physical and mental health and even their lives. 
It was World Suicide Prevention Day on 10 September, and I was reminded of the novelist John Niven’s powerful account of his brother’s death from suicide at the end of a combination of health, social and debt problems that became overwhelming. Everyone in the financial services system has an almost Hippocratic duty to treat customers fairly. Access to credit can enhance quality of life – as long as the debt is collected with a focus on affordability and the welfare of the customer. For many people, however, having financial resilience in the form of rainy day savings is a key protection against the problems that life can bring. 
One of the best parts of my job as chair of the FCA is meeting people outside the organisation and hearing about the financial challenges they face and how the work of the FCA affects them. I have seen a number of inspiring examples of how firms, voluntary organisations, consumer groups and local government are using their initiative to help the most vulnerable in society more effectively access the combination of services they need. In particular, I’ve seen the power of good debt advice to turn people’s lives around so that they can build their financial resilience – and the danger of bad debt advice making it worse.   
We now live in a world where people work, save and borrow in a fundamentally different way to the way they did 10 years ago. But it is my sincere belief that if regulators and financial service firms are closely attuned to the needs of vulnerable customers we will be able to rebuild the trust in financial services which was lost 10 years ago.  
With that in mind, I encourage you to respond to our Discussion Paper on a Duty of Care that we published alongside our Approach to Consumers before the discussion closes in November.

Hot topics
SM&CR
Have your say: Consultation on SM&CR for claims management companies launched
Claims management companies (CMCs) come under our regulation from next April and we’ll be providing updates to help you get ready for the change and authorisation.
We’re currently consulting on extending the Senior Management and Certification Regime (SM&CR) to CMCs. The Consultation Paper launched today (20/09/18) sets out our draft rules and guidance for CMCs relating to the SM&CR.  
Bringing the claims management industry in line with other financial services firms, the changes are part of improving professional standards, conduct and governance. The SM&CR aims to reduce harm to consumers and strengthen market integrity by making individuals more accountable for their conduct. This will benefit consumers and firms and improve trust in the industry by reducing bad practice, including aggressive sales tactics.  
Firms’ culture and governance is a continuing priority for us.  
The deadline for responding to the consultation is 6 December 2018. 
Our Senior Managers and Certification Regime will begin extending to CMCs from December 2019 when nearly all employees will have to abide by Conduct Rules and some senior managers will have to be approved by us.
It is important that claims management companies understand these proposals and what they mean for them. They should read the consultation and sign up to our email updates to receive details of the events we are holding in the autumn. At these events, we’ll explain our proposals, listen to your views and give you the chance to ask us questions. You can register to attend here.
Later this year, we will give claims management companies more information about the next steps we will take to transfer them from being regulated by the Claims Management Regulator to us. We will publish the final rules in a policy statement in spring 2019.
See our website for more information and support on preparing for regulation, including our consultation on Fees which is also currently open.
Communications Approach to final regulatory technical standards and draft EBA guidance under the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2)
We have published a consultation CP 18/25 on our Approach to final Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) and EBA guidelines under the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2). The consultation closes 12 October 2018.  
We are consulting on new rules and amendments to our guidance particularly in relation to the security of customers’ payments and how firms interact for the purposes of ‘open banking’. We are aligning our approach with final EBA guidelines on fraud reporting and Passporting RTS. We are also taking the opportunity to clarify our existing expectations based on our practical experience of authorising and registering firms under PSD2 since September 2017. In addition, complaints reporting rules are being extended to cover authorised push payment fraud.  
All payment service providers, including banks, building societies, payment and e-money institutions should read the CP.

Banks and Building Societies
Outsourcing
We have completed a review of retail banks’ use of outsourcing. The potential types of harm arising from outsourcing include service disruption (impacting consumers’ access to products and services) and poor customer service. We focused on firms’ approaches to outsourcing and did not test whether these are mitigating the risk of harm in practice.  
Overall, we did not identify significant concerns. Below are some areas for firms to consider: 
In November 2017 the Prudential Regulatory Authority introduced a prescribed responsibility for outsourcing. Firms should be clear that those assigned this prescribed responsibility have overall accountability for outsourcing. This includes where the responsibility for managing third parties is delegated. 
Firms must continue to have robust governance arrangements for outsourcing, including effective processes to identify, manage, monitor and report the risks it is (or might be) exposed to, as appropriate. These arrangements should help firms identify and reduce the potential harm to consumers if things were to go wrong.
Consumers can be exposed to potential harm when a firm’s third party relationship ends, particularly if it ends unexpectedly. Robust oversight arrangements, that include sufficiently tested exit plans for different scenarios, will help reduce the potential harm by ensuring business continuity.
Firms appear to be increasingly considering outsourcing to the cloud. We explained our expectations in this area in July’s Regulation Round-up. 
The EBA is currently consulting on draft Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements.
We have a continued focus on outsourcing and may undertake further work in this area.

Mortgage Advisers and Lenders
Insurance brokers due diligence on insurers
The recent failures of Alpha, Enterprise and Gable demonstrate the harm that can be caused to customers if an insurer fails and is unable to pay the claims. Our publication ‘Insurance brokers and due diligence on insurers’ addresses the vital role that insurance brokers have to play in preventing further instances of customer harm through failing insurers. 
Insurance brokers are viewed as trusted professionals with insurance expertise. We expect them to demonstrate that they have carefully considered the insurers that they place their customers’ business with. To support this, we list examples of what brokers should consider as part of their insurer due diligence with links to relevant web pages.  
Our message is clear on the importance of providing clear insurer details to allow customers to make informed decisions on where their insurance is being placed.
We plan further work to verify that insurance brokers are conducting appropriate due diligence on the insurers they use.
Live & Local 2018/19 events
The new series of monthly ‘Ask the regulator’ Q&A roundtable discussions featuring senior FCA representatives and industry experts will begin this month in Leicester. Registration is currently open for sessions taking place until December – details can be found on our Live & Local webpage. Additional dates and locations in 2019 will be announced later this year.

Payment Service Providers
Payment Services – do you need to make a notification under the Limited Network Exclusion?
Services that are based on specific payment instruments that can only be used in a limited way are excluded from the requirement for permission under the Payment Services Regulations 2017. Services that are excluded are set out in Schedule 1 Part 2 (k)(i)-(iii) PSRs. Regulation 38 PSRs requires providers of services falling within the exclusion to notify us if the total value of payment transactions in any period of 12 months exceeds €1 million. We will assess the notification to determine whether the services that are being provided fall within Part 2(k)(i)-(iii). 
Deadline
If the conditions for notification are met on 13 January 2019, the service provider must submit the notification online through the Connect portal by 10 February 2019. From 13 January 2019, service providers must submit their first notification no later than 28 days from the date on which the conditions for notification were met. 
See our Directions: https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/documents/limited-network-exclusion-direction.pdf.
For examples see Q40 in section 15.5 of our Perimeter Guidance Manual: https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/PERG/15/?view=chapter
Live & Local events in London and Manchester
As part of the Live & Local 2018/19 programme, we are holding events in London and Manchester tailored for non-bank payment services firms.

These events will also offer you an opportunity to ask us questions and meet our Payments Department. 
The events take place in September and November 2018. Dates, locations and registration link are available on the Live & Local webpage.

EU Withdrawal
FCA’s role in preparing for EU withdrawal
Earlier in the summer, we published an update on how we are preparing for the UK leaving the European Union. This includes setting out how we will amend EU binding technical standards (detailed EU rules) and our Handbook to ensure they can function effectively when the UK leaves the EU.
Statutory instruments
As part of its approach to amending financial services legislation under the EU (Withdrawal) Act, The Treasury has begun laying Statutory Instruments (SIs) in Parliament. Six SIs have been laid to date, including the SI establishing a temporary permissions regime for FSMA firms operating in the UK under a financial services passport. The Treasury has also begun publishing a number of draft SIs, ahead of them being laid Parliament, to give stakeholders an opportunity to engage and familiarise themselves with the draft provisions. Firms do not need to prepare to implement this legislation now. Please see the Treasury website for more information.
Payment and electronic money institutions
The Treasury has published a draft of the legislation which will create the temporary permissions regime for EEA payment institutions, electronic money institutions and registered account information service providers. Further information is included in the policy notes that accompany the draft legislation.
Temporary permissions regime
The Treasury published the statutory instrument on TPR on 24 July. We have provided more details on the TPR on our website for firms and funds currently passporting into the UK.

Claims management companies (CMCs): fees consultation paper
We have published a consultation paper which sets out a proposed fee structure to recover the costs of setting up the new regulatory regime for CMCs and the ongoing costs of regulating CMCs from 1 April 2019. Meanwhile, responsibility for considering complaints about CMCs will transfer from the Legal Ombudsman to the Financial Ombudsman Service, so we also set out our proposals for recovering the associated transfer costs and the Financial Ombudsman Service’s ongoing costs. 
Read the consultation and respond by 22 October 2018.
SM&CR – Insurers conversion forms open
Insurers can now access and submit the draft forms for converting Approved Persons Regime (APR) approvals to Senior Management Functions (SMFs). The deadline submitting forms is midnight on 2 December 2018.
If you work for a dual-regulated insurer, you should first check if you need to submit forms. You can check what you need to do in the Guide to the Senior Managers and Certification Regime for Insurers. Generally, you will need to if you work for a Solvency II firm, a large Non-Directive Firm (NDF) or an incoming branch.

Firms’ culture and governance is a continuing priority for us. The aim of the SM&CR is to reduce harm to consumers and help strengthen the integrity of the market by making individuals more accountable for their conduct. Nearly all employees of CMCs will have to abide by Conduct Rules and some senior managers will have to be approved by us.
We want CMCs to be trusted providers of high quality, good value services that can truly help customers. A key element of our approach will be ensuring consumers are protected and treated fairly.
It is important that CMCs understand these proposals and what they mean for them. They should read the consultation and sign up to our email updates to receive details of the events we are considering holding for them in the autumn. CMCs who are interested in attending an event should sign up online.
Please send any feedback to us before 6 December.
Later this year, we will give CMCs more information about the next steps we will take to transfer them from being regulated by the Claims Management Regulator to the Financial Conduct Authority. You can read further information about the transfer here.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority
Dear CEO LIBOR letter,Statements,19/09/2018,19/09/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/dear-ceo-libor-letter,"On Wednesday 19 September, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) wrote to CEOs of major banks and insurers supervised in the UK asking for the preparations and actions they are taking to manage transition from LIBOR to alternative interest rate benchmarks. The purpose of the letters is to seek assurance that firms’ senior managers and Boards understand the risks associated with this transition and are taking appropriate action now so that firms can transition to alternative rates ahead of the end of 2021.
These letters were sent to the largest banks and insurers in the first instance. Firms which have not received a direct email from their supervision team linking to the letters are not within scope of this request, however we encourage all firms that currently rely on LIBOR to read and reflect on this letter. The continued participation and commitment of market participants to address the various challenges during this transition will be an essential part of the success of this collective effort. The Bank of England, PRA and FCA are grateful to firms for their engagement with this market-led transition effort to date.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

The FCA announces outcome of investigation into 4 life insurance companies,Press Releases,19/09/2018,19/09/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-announces-outcome-investigation-4-life-insurance-companies,"The FCA launched the investigation following a thematic review, published on 3 March 2016. This identified further work was required to determine whether 6 of the 11 firms that were involved in the thematic review had failed to meet our standards. These 6 firms were Abbey Life, Countrywide Assured, Old Mutual, Police Mutual, Prudential and Scottish Widows.
The investigations into Police Mutual and Scottish Widows were closed earlier without further action.
All of the remaining investigations have now been closed. The FCA found the conduct of the 4 remaining firms (Abbey Life, Old Mutual, Prudential and Countrywide Assured) did not warrant enforcement action. In each firm, some issues have been identified during the investigations, which are being addressed as part of our ongoing supervision of those firms.
The FCA published its Final Guidance publication in December 2016. This sets out the expectations on how life insurance firms treat their closed-book customers fairly, including when disclosing the existence of paid-up and exit charges to existing customers.   
The FCA will continue to assess life insurance firms’ adherence to the required standards and Principles, and take appropriate steps where necessary.
Notes to editors
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this, it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

Pensions: A view from the FCA,Speeches,17/09/2018,17/09/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/pensions-view-fca-andrew-bailey-gleneagles,"Speaker: Andrew Bailey, Chief ExecutiveEvent: GleneaglesDelivered: 15 September 2018Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version
Highlights
We know that a large proportion of people are not saving enough – if at all – for their retirement.
We are looking at competition in the retirement income market as we want to ensure that products are available that meet the needs of consumers.
We are not convinced about charge capping in this market but it remains an option.
At Gleneagles, 2 years ago, I spoke about the macro-economic perspective, and particularly the role of the lifetime saving model and how it can illustrate the challenges of today. I’m not going to give that speech again, honestly, but I do want to reprise one or two points, just to take the argument on.
The model says that people make choices about how they spend and save at each point in their lives limited only by the resources available over their whole lives and thus independent of income at each point in their lives. Decisions on spending and saving at each point in people’s lives are thus linked to building up and running down assets to provide for retirement, among other things.
Ok, but what that tells us is that at each point in our lifetime we take decisions in the context of a series of judgements about the whole of our lifetime over which there is a very large degree of uncertainty. Let me pick out 4: our life expectancy; our lifetime earnings; our lifetime spending and saving; and the expected real interest rates over the course of a lifetime, which determine the cost of saving and borrowing and are factored into discount rates for asset valuations.
It goes without saying that all of these are highly uncertain, and subject to risks either way. Let’s look at a few changes: average life expectancy has been on a steadily rising course, though in the last couple of years the rate of increase has reduced. For the last 10 years – since the financial crisis – long-term real interest rates have been at a low, and at times negative level, a very unusual occurrence at a time when by longer historical standards inflation has been quite stable. And there are good reasons to believe that the equilibrium real interest rate – ‘R-star’ as economists call it – has fallen. On the borrowing side, much more of the cost of student education is being transferred to individuals in the form of debt obligations to be paid off later. On the saving and investment side, for many the real cost of housing has increased. Now, let’s throw in the ingredient that we are most interested in here. There has been a progressive shift in the responsibility for both retirement saving and pension drawing from employers and the state to individuals.
There has been a progressive shift in the responsibility for both retirement saving and pension drawing from employers and the state to individuals.
Amid these changes, the lifetime model remains in my view the best organising framework to consider the issues we face. The basic pattern that individuals typically move from being net debtors to net asset owners across their working lives and then draw down on those assets in retirement has not changed. But, the contours of the pattern have changed and I would argue that there is now more uncertainty about how those contours will take shape as generations and within them individuals age. We are seeing some large inter-generational shifts in those contours, and they raise very important issues in the area of pensions and long-term saving and indebtedness. Moreover, the increase in uncertainty poses very clear challenges not just for the provision of pensions, but also for the provision of advice to individuals on the decisions that go with pensions. There is no doubt a tension, even a contradiction, between the degree of uncertainty and the apparent certainty embedded in the design of financial instruments.
One of the important things that we at the FCA have done in the last 2 years is to publish our first Financial Lives study, we think the most comprehensive study to date of the financial lives of a set of UK residents. And, with deference to the lifetime model, it is no coincidence that the first version we published split the population up by age (we have if you are interested since published the same study on a regional basis). What did we find of relevance? Quite a lot perhaps unsurprisingly, and the evidence we found is consistent with what we see and hear elsewhere. Debt levels among the younger age cohorts – broadly up to the mid-30s – have increased (since we don’t have a time series of our survey, we have to rely on other evidence to support what we found in terms of change over time). A good part of this increase represents student loans, and of course it is important to note that the adjustment to larger student loans is still working its way through the age cohorts. There is a debate about whether student loans are strictly debt or not, and the answer is that it depends for what purpose they are being assessed, but for the lifetime model they should be counted in because on average people will repay them out of income.
A second observation is that along with the increase in the real cost of housing for many goes later entry into the owner-occupier housing market, and thus mortgages extending later into life. Another part of this story is that we are seeing the average term of mortgage lending increase in response to the higher real cost of housing. Again, these are changes that are still working their way through age cohorts, and so we can expect to see further changes in the contours of the lifetime model. But it is reasonable I think to conclude that debt servicing costs will on average be larger for longer into people’s lifetimes. And, of course, this means that they are competing with saving for retirement, and at times when in the past people have tended to increase such saving as debt servicing costs fall.
What do we see in terms of evidence on retirement saving? Our Financial Lives Survey indicated that just over 15 million adults in the UK who are not retired claim they are not currently paying into a pension. We also found that a sizeable proportion of defined contribution (DC) pension savers have relatively little in their pension pot. Around 22% have less than £5,000 and a further 14% between £5,000 and £20,000. Moreover, we found that 24% of employees did not have a pension. In recent years, governments have taken important steps to tackle this issue, notably auto-enrolment and the creation of the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) and we welcome these steps. Auto-enrolment has already made a difference to the number of consumers saving into a pension, and there is more to come. And, we welcome the Department for Work and Pensions’ (DWP’s) review of auto-enrolment. Another of the findings of Financial Lives was that 51% of self-employed people, who are not currently covered by auto-enrolment, do not have a pension at all. It is good that this is under consideration as part of the DWP review.
Before moving on to what the FCA is doing, I want to tackle one big question which is linked to the whole issue of the changing contours of the lifetime model, namely are the pension freedoms still the right approach? It would I suppose be possible to duck the question by arguing that it is too late to change course, but I think it still merits an answer based on the latest evidence. The answer for me is Yes, the freedoms remain the right course to follow, but supplemented by an expansion in the scale and scope of auto-enrolment, so it isn’t a total free-for-all. My reason for taking this view is that while the contours of the lifetime model will always change, it is unlikely that we will turn the clock back in the foreseeable future, and greater freedom of choice over decumulation – when and by how much and in what form pensions are put into payment – makes a great deal of sense in terms of the shifts in and uncertainty around the lifetime model.
But – and there is always a ‘but’ I’m afraid – we need to be very aware and alert to the consequence I mentioned earlier, that we have transferred the responsibility for a very complex area of decision-making to individuals, and we need to do all we can to help people make those decisions. And that is where the FCA, among others, comes in.
As a reminder, the FCA regulates firms that operate contract-based pension schemes: these are schemes based on individual contracts between the member and the provider. They include personal pension schemes such as self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs). The Pensions Regulator (TPR) covers trust-based schemes where a scheme asset is held in a trust for the benefit of members. In term of numbers, there are around £2.4 trillion of pension assets in the UK, of which around £955 billion is in the FCA world and £1.45 trillion in the TPR world, with the balance gradually shifting towards FCA regulated schemes.
The FCA’s other main role in this area is to be the conduct and prudential regulator for financial advisers, brokers and other firms and individuals advising on and selling, retirement income products, to be the conduct regulator for insurers, and to monitor and set the standards under which Pension Wise operates.
The FCA has 3 operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers. They rank equally: we don’t have a hierarchy, and it would not be appropriate for us to have one. It does mean that we are a full-scale competition regulator, and in this context we want to see a more competitive retirement income market with products that meet the needs of consumers.
The pension reforms have provided the opportunity for the FCA to take a sector wide look at the retirement income market that we regulate. We started this work with the Retirement Income Market Study, the final report of which was published in March 2015. This found that a lack of shopping around meant consumers were missing out on the most appropriate annuities for them, so-called ’wake-up packs‘ were too long and hard to understand, and consumers were highly sensitive in terms of their choices to the way retirement income options are presented.
The pension freedoms have been the backdrop to the next stage of our market-wide work, the Retirement Outcomes Review launched in July 2016. The purpose of the review has been to assess the role of competition in a market where products and options for accessing retirement income have become more fragmented. We have looked at how consumers and firms have been responding to the pension freedoms; focusing particularly on those consumers who do not take regulated advice.
Obviously, the review has taken place against market and consumer behaviour that has been responding to the new freedoms, but we are seeing some clear patterns emerge.
Since the introduction of the freedoms in April 2015, just under 2 million pension pots have been accessed for the first time. Around half of these are full withdrawals of the cash in the pot, though it is important to bear in mind that the average size of these withdrawn pots is small at around £15,000. Moreover, full withdrawal of cash is more likely to be undertaken by people under the age of 65.
In terms of pensions coming into payment and the type of payment product, there is strong growth in drawdown products and a reduction in annuity sales. Of course, in terms of the stock of pensions in payment, annuities still dominate, with the latest figures showing just over 7 million annuity contracts in payment versus around 860,000 drawdown plans. That will, however, change over time. Interestingly, the latest figures we have for the 6 months to the end of March this year show that around 60% of drawdown sales involve no income taken. The latest figures suggest that around 30% of drawdowns were non-advised, and for both drawdowns and annuities the proportion of non-advised sales has increased. The evidence also suggests that around one in three individuals was unaware of where their pension assets were invested, but the proportion using pensions guidance is rising, albeit that figure remains just over 10%, suggesting a sizeable proportion taking neither advice nor guidance.
The pension reforms have provided the opportunity for the FCA to take a sector wide look at the retirement income market that we regulate.
The important question is what do we make of all this, accepting that it remains early days on the freedoms? The switch from annuities to drawdowns is unsurprising, and was a main plank of the change. Cashing out small pots is in one sense unsurprising. The proportion of drawdowns not involving income taken strikes me as a good example of the sort of flexibility people want to have under the freedoms.
Finally, the pattern on advice and guidance underlines three important challenges where I want to see progress: first, in the light of the finalisation of the Financial Advice Market Review (FAMR), that it does provide greater confidence particularly in the advice: guidance boundary; second, that innovation and technology does begin to assist in the challenge of providing lower cost advice for those with smaller and/or simpler needs; and third, that the welcome introduction of the Single Financial Guidance Body does lead to greater awareness and use of pension guidance, and particularly Pension Wise.
Meanwhile, we have recently published the final findings of the Retirement Outcomes Review, and intend to have final rules on all the issues raised in place by next July, to be followed by an implementation period. Overall, we have concluded that many consumers have welcomed the pension freedoms and the ability to access their savings in ways that they previously could not. But we have also seen that many consumers, particularly when focused on taking their tax-free cash, take the path of least resistance and enter drawdown with their existing provider. We expect levels of engagement to increase over time as pot sizes grow, and we found some support for that conclusion from the experience elsewhere in the world. However, as pots become larger, those who do not engage effectively could lose out on income in retirement, through poor investment choices or paying higher fees and charges.
One dog that has so far not barked is that while commentators have flagged the risk of consumers drawing down their pension assets at unsustainable rates, we have not so far seen much evidence of this taking place. This is unsurprising I think, not least because on the basis of the numbers of pot sizes drawn down, they would not allow much of a Lamborghini to be bought. And, to be clear, while I always try to ensure that the FCA’s observations are well researched, this is on the basis of absolutely zero experience on my part at least of trying to buy a Lamborghini. However, as pot sizes increase and DC pension savings become a more central part of many consumers pension wealth, the broader issue of unsustainable rates of drawdown will be important to watch out for.
We were concerned to see that some providers were ‘defaulting’ consumers into cash or cash-like assets. Just over 30% of non-advised drawdown consumers are wholly holding cash. This may suit consumers planning to drawdown their entire pot over a short period, but it is unlikely to suit those drawing down over a longer period. We estimate that over half of these consumers are likely to be losing out on income in retirement by holding cash. Someone who wants to drawdown their pot over a 20-year period could increase their expected annual income by over 30% by investing in a mix of assets rather than just cash.
We are also concerned about the high proportion of consumers fully withdrawing their pension pots to move savings elsewhere. In many cases, keeping money in a pension would have resulted in better returns on average, and in paying less tax (and this is a general observation, not tax advice from the FCA, to be clear). Some consumers might also lose out on employer contributions and other benefits as a result. We found this behaviour was partly driven by a lack of trust in pensions, stemming from a range of factors including past pension scandals and frequent changes to pension rules and tax treatment.
Our evidence also suggests that if firms offer consumers a more structured set of options – making the decision simpler to navigate – it can improve the investment outcomes for consumers, better aligning with their objectives in retirement.
We also found weak competitive pressures and low levels of switching in the non-advised drawdown market, and looked at whether this might drive higher prices and less innovation. Comparing the behaviour of advised and non-advised consumers presents a starkly different picture. 94% of consumers who accessed their pots without taking advice accepted the drawdown option offered by their pension provider, compared to 35% for advised consumers. Given this lack of competitive pressure, we are concerned that consumers might pay too much in charges. Our evidence indicated that charges for non-advised consumers can vary substantially between products and are on average higher than in accumulation. We estimated that by switching from a higher cost provider to a lower cost-one, consumers could increase their annual income by up to 13%.
Drawdown charges can be complex, opaque and hard to compare. Products can have as many as 44 charges linked to them. This makes it difficult for consumers to compare and shop around for the best products for their needs, and this limits competitive pressures on providers. Similarly, our review of non-advised drawdown pension sales, published in March, found that some consumers struggle to fully engage with the information providers give them. This can affect the quality of decisions.
So far, we have not seen significant product innovation for mass-market consumers. The market is of course still in the process of adjusting to pension freedoms, and the incentives to innovate will increase as pot sizes grow. For that reason, we intend to allow more time for the market to develop before we consider whether further action is needed on product innovation, but it will be a very clear focus for us over time.
Our focus therefore in framing measures to take to respond to these findings has been to seek to shape an emerging market, not shake-up an entrenched one. Our objectives include improving the effectiveness of consumer communication before they access their pension savings, and that they have appropriate access to support and guidance. To improve engagement, we are therefore proposing that consumers should receive wake-up packs earlier and then more consistently, so from the age of 50 and subsequently every 5 years until they fully crystallise their pension pot. There should be a single page summary in the pack, and clear risk warnings. This seems to me to be consistent with the changing contours of the lifetime model.
We also want to ensure that consumers receive the support they need, from regulated advisers, providers and Pension Wise.
We have also floated a number of ideas which are not yet ready for consultation, in the sense that fuller evaluation is needed, including on how they could apply to SIPPS. One is to introduce a more structured approach to engaging in decisions by creating a small number of ‘pathways’ (we have suggested 3 might be an appropriate number of such pathways) which would provide sensible options for those with fairly straightforward needs. There is a careful balance to be struck here: on the one hand, we want to see consistent help for those at risk of being lost in complexity; but we recognise the danger of it becoming 3-sizes-fit-all, and particularly in view of the points I made earlier about the contours of the lifetime model.
Another floated idea is preventing firms from defaulting drawdown consumers into cash, to make sure that investing in cash is an active decision in drawdown rather than something that happens due to indecision. Alongside that, there is a good case for more transparency on drawdown features, including charges, both for those considering it and those already in it. For annuity purchases, we are proposing to extend our information prompt to cover enhanced annuities, which should result in more consumers getting a better annuity rate. 
Finally, on the review, we have considered whether there should be charge capping, a point raised by the Work and Pensions Committee. At this stage we are not convinced, though the option is not closed off, and would never be so. But in a market where we want to see evolution and innovation it is hard to know the right price, and there could be negative effects on innovation and competition. As a point of reference, the fee level of 0.75% on default arrangements in accumulation would at the least prompt the question of why fees for some other products are higher for some consumers. Our intention is to review charges in the light of how they evolve, as part of the review we will undertake around a year after implementation of rule changes arising from the Retirement Outcomes Review. If we find problems with charges, then capping will be on the table as a response.
We have to do all that we can do enable individuals to take these decisions, and we have to be prepared to intervene early.
To conclude on the review and the context in which it has been undertaken, I continue to believe that the pension freedoms are an appropriate response to the changes in the lifetime model, and the uncertainties around what can happen in the future. But, we must recognise that these changes are another part of a longer shift towards making individuals responsible for retirement saving and the complex decisions that go with it. So, we have to do all that we can do enable individuals to take these decisions, and we have to be prepared to intervene early, while the market is still developing. The benefits of doing this will come if we avoid unwanted practices becoming entrenched and over time consumers have confidence in their pensions.
I want to finish by briefly mentioning another initiative that we are pursuing. We and TPR have committed to publishing a joint Pensions Strategy. The intention is to outline our priorities for the next 5 to 10 years and our appraisal of the risks facing consumers. It will set out our respective remits and how we work together. Over the course of this year we have held a number of joint events around the country to engage with as many stakeholders as possible. You might be thinking now, ’why has it taken until now to come up with the idea of a joint strategy?’. I don’t know the answer to that one, but I can say that it seems to make sense now more than ever in view of the fluid picture as pensions and long-term savings adapt to the challenges at the extent I set out at the start in discussing the lifetime model.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Michael Nascimento sentenced to 11 years’ imprisonment in FCA prosecution of £2.8m investment fraud,Press Releases,17/09/2018,17/09/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/michael-nascimento-sentenced-11-years-imprisonment-fca-prosecution-investment-fraud-operation-tidworth,"Between July 2010 and April 2014, members of the public were cold-called and subjected to high pressure sales tactics to persuade them to purchase shares in a company that owned land on the island of Madeira. The investors were told that the value of the shares would increase substantially when permission to build 20 villas was granted, thereby enhancing the land’s value. Investors were promised guaranteed returns of between 125% and 228%. None were ever paid. Investors’ money was used to maintain the fraud and particularly to fund the lifestyle of Mr Nascimento. Over 170 members of the public invested more than £2.8 million in the shares. Many were elderly or vulnerable, and lost life-changing sums, in some cases all their life savings.
Today’s sentencing follows that of five other individuals involved in the same fraud on 4 September 2018 and takes the total imprisonment for all 6 individuals to 28.5 years.
Commenting on the case, Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:
'This brings to an end the FCA’s largest fraud prosecution which has seen the perpetrators imprisoned for a total of 28.5 years, affording justice to victims who were the subject of their calculated deception. We are continuing to fight for compensation for victims out of their assets.'
In sentencing Mr Nascimento, which was concluded today at Southwark Crown Court, the trial judge, His Honour Judge Hehir, remarked that Mr Nascimento had shown 'utter cynicism and contempt' for some of the victims. He also said it was 'particularly repellent' that elderly people had been specifically targeted and that many of the victims were vulnerable. He said that some of the stories he had heard during the trial were 'positively heart-breaking' and that many of the victims had suffered 'life-shattering losses'.  The Judge said, 'despicable was not too strong a word' to describe some of Mr Nascimento’s actions.
The Judge commented that Mr Nascimento was 'very adept at getting others to do his dirty work for [him]' and that many of his actions were 'specifically designed to frustrate the task of the FCA and to prevent apprehension' but nonetheless 'the FCA had built a formidable case' against him. Mr Nascimento 'very rarely broke cover and revealed his identity' however, where he did he was 'quite happy to defraud people [he] was looking at in the eye'. He also added that 'over a period of years [Mr Nascimento] acted single-mindedly in pursuit of riches through fraud.'
Mr Nascimento also received an additional sentence of 2 years for further criminality in respect of a separate prosecution by the Crown Prosecution Service and the City of London Police. This makes his total sentence 13 years.
On 4 September 2018, Charanjit Sandhu who featured in the previous FCA press release in relation to this case received an additional consecutive sentence of 3.5 years in relation to matters prosecuted separately by the Crown Prosecution Service, City of London Police and Kent Police. Taking account of the 5.5 years sentence passed in Operation Tidworth, this makes his total sentence 9 years’ imprisonment.

"The Financial Conduct Authority bans former Deutsche Bank trader, Christian Bittar",Press Releases,14/09/2018,14/09/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/financial-conduct-authority-bans-former-deutsche-bank-trader-christian-bittar,"Mr Bittar formerly worked at Deutsche Bank where he traded interest rate derivative products referenced to benchmarks including EURIBOR. The FCA has found that Mr Bittar lacks integrity and therefore fitness and propriety to carry out such a role. Mr Bittar made requests to EURIBOR submitters to make high or low EURIBOR submissions, both internally to Deutsche Bank submitters and externally to traders at other EURIBOR panel banks. He did so to benefit the profitability of the trading positions for which he was responsible and, on occasion, the profitability of the trading positions of other traders.
Mark Steward, director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA said:
“The FCA’s Decision Notice against Mr Bittar, which was issued in April 2017, can now be published. It is a detailed account of how Mr Bittar sought to manipulate EURIBOR. It is a tale of gross misconduct and betrayal of the public interest in financial benchmarks.
“If he had not been convicted and imprisoned for the same matters, the FCA would have sought a financial penalty of £6.5 million. As it is, we have prohibited him from performing any regulated function, reinforcing the message of the criminal court.'
Between March 2005 and June 2009, Mr Bittar made at least 81 requests to Deutsche Bank submitters for high or low EURIBOR submissions to benefit trading positions. Mr Bittar was involved in at least 79 communications with traders at other EURIBOR panel banks whereby he either made requests or received requests for high or low EURIBOR submissions. Mr Bittar knew that it was improper for him to make such requests to the Deutsche Bank submitters and improper to collude with traders at other banks with a view to EURIBOR submissions being made which would benefit trading positions.
Approach to financial penalty
On 13 April 2017, the FCA issued Mr Bittar with a Decision Notice which imposed a financial penalty on Mr Bittar of £6.5 million. Mr Bittar referred the Decision Notice to the Upper Tribunal on 10 May 2017. The Upper Tribunal proceedings were stayed on 1 August 2017 pending the final determination of the criminal proceedings against Mr Bittar for conspiracy to defraud which were based on substantially the same matters as in the FCA proceedings.
Mr Bittar pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud in the criminal action on 2 March 2018 and on 20 July 2018 he was sentenced to 5 years and 4 months in prison.  He was also ordered to pay £2.5 million by way of confiscation order.
In light of the orders made in the criminal proceedings, and with the consent of the parties, on 14 September 2018, the Upper Tribunal directed the FCA not to impose a financial penalty on Mr Bittar, and otherwise ordered that the reference be dismissed. This means the FCA’s initial decision to prohibit Mr Bittar is now a final decision.
For more information contact the FCA press office on 020 7066 3232, [email protected].
Notes to editors
The Final Notice.
The Order of the Upper Tribunal dated 14 September 2018 dismissing the reference.
The FCA has imposed 7 fines, totalling £426 million, on firms for misconduct relating to IBOR.
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this, it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

Our approach to overseas market operators seeking to apply to become a recognised overseas investment exchange (ROIE),Statements,14/09/2018,14/09/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/our-approach-overseas-market-operators-seeking-apply-become-recognised-overseas-investment-exchange,"We continue to prepare for a range of scenarios, including one in which the UK leaves the EU without a deal and without entering an implementation period.
Current situation
EEA market operators (as defined by MiFID II) who operate a regulated market, a multilateral trading facility (MTF) or an organised trading facility (OTF) currently rely on MiFID II passport rights to enable members based in the UK access to their markets, where they engage in regulated activities to do so.
What will change after Brexit
Once the UK has left the EU, passport rights will no longer apply to MiFID II EEA market operators seeking to facilitate the participation of the exchange in UK markets.
The Treasury is not planning to put in place a temporary recognition regime for EEA market operators in the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal and without entering an implementation period.
EEA market operators who currently make use of passport rights may therefore wish to apply to be recognised as a ROIE.
EEA market operators which do not maintain a permanent place of business in the UK may be able to rely on the overseas persons exclusion following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, to the extent that they would otherwise be deemed to be carrying on a regulated activity in the UK.
However, EEA market operators who cannot rely on the overseas persons exclusion and who undertake regulated activities in the UK should seek appropriate FCA permissions such as recognition as a Recognised Overseas Investment Exchange. Market operators should seek their own advice on the application of the UK regulatory framework to their circumstances. 
The direction
The direction clarifies our expectations of EEA market operators. We have streamlined the application requirements where possible, considering that EEA market operators are subject to the MiFID II/MiFIR regime. Supervisory cooperation will remain a key element of the ROIE regime.
Read the direction (PDF) 
How to make an application
The direction sets out the way an application must be made, for us to assess whether the recognition requirements have been met.
Market operators should contact [email protected]  as soon as possible to make us aware of their plans in relation to any arrangements they intend to maintain in the UK.  Please also contact  [email protected] as soon as possible if you are considering making an application. 
Complete applications should be received as soon as possible.  As we explain in our Handbook, applications should be made not later than 6 months before the applicant wishes a ROIE recognition order to take effect.
The application should be accompanied by the fee, as set out in the direction, to be considered complete.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Provisional liquidator appointed in respect of Total Debt Relief Limited,News stories,13/09/2018,14/09/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/provisional-liquidator-appointed-respect-total-debt-relief-limited,"Stephen Hunt of Griffins Insolvency Litigation Forensics has been appointed as Provisional liquidator. As the appointment is provisional, the management of TDR will have the opportunity to challenge the FCA’s concerns before the Court and to apply to have the appointment of the Provisional Liquidator set aside.
The FCA had concerns over how the debt management company was handling the money of its customers. The FCA has therefore taken various steps to protect the interests of TDR’s clients, ultimately applying for the Provisional Liquidator to be appointed so he can take steps to secure client funds. The FCA has also launched an investigation into the activities of the firm.
The FCA is writing to all affected TDR customers to advise them of the free help and advice that is available to them through the Money Advice Service and will continue to work closely with the firm to ensure that customers are treated fairly.
TDR is a debt management company which operates a full and final settlement model.
This typically sees the customer make payments to the debt management firm which, in turn, makes a minimum or nominal payment to the creditor. The remaining balance of the payment from the customer less fees is held by the debt management firm to create an accumulated fund over time which is then used in negotiations with creditors.
Who to contact
For queries relating to the firm
Customers should contact the Provisional Liquidator if they are concerned, or for any updates.
The Provisional Liquidator will gather as much information as possible from creditors and clients of the firm about payments made to, or owed by, the firm. Customers of TDR who believe that they are owed money by the firm should contact [email protected] as soon as possible.
They will ask you to provide the following information:
client reference number
copy of any agreements you may have entered into with TDR or other proof of debt
full name
address and contact details

Charles Randell speech at the Annual Public Meeting 2018,Speeches,11/09/2018,11/09/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/charles-randell-speech-annual-public-meeting-2018,"Speaker: Charles Randell, Chair, Financial Conduct AuthorityLocation: Annual Public Meeting, QEII Centre, WestminsterDelivered on: 11 September 2018
Highlights:
Ten years on since Lehman’s collapsed, we still do not have a settled financial services sector.
The FCA has tough choices about where to focus its attention and resources, particularly as the external environment develops and changes. 
Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version.
Good morning and thank you for attending this year’s Annual Public Meeting. The FCA takes its public accountability duty extremely seriously. So, we appreciate your time today.
In terms of the running order, our priority this morning – as ever – is to respond to your questions and comments.
But before opening the meeting to the floor, we would like to provide a little background to this year’s Annual Report. I’ll provide a brief introduction and then hand over to our chief executive, Andrew Bailey, who’ll go through the reporting period in more detail.
I would like to start this morning though with a couple of personal observations of the FCA from my first 5 months as Chair.
The first is this: it is an organisation that is strongly committed to delivering public value. And I’ll return to this point throughout my introduction. My second observation is a more general one around our response to the current operating environment.
This week marks the tenth anniversary of Lehman’s bankruptcy filing. The global financial crisis revealed problems in financial firms and their behaviour which have had a devastating impact on many people, including some of you here today. Ten years on from Lehman, the broad shape of new regulations is reasonably clear, but we are regulating a sector that changes year-to-year, even month-to-month.
Our Mission
That doesn’t make things easy, but last year’s Mission statement gave us a very clear framework for prioritising work and resource, with a focus on protecting the most vulnerable customers.
It also established the FCA’s commitment to develop and refine its approach to deliver in the public interest. Meaning we are willing to learn from what works and what doesn’t.
Adaptability is essential to managing the depth and breadth of developments that we see today in financial services.
But as I say in my introduction to the Annual Report, we do have tough choices to make.
Adaptability is essential to managing the depth and breadth of developments that we see today in financial services.
We will also have to respond to factors that are not always under our control. And there are two that I particularly want to draw your attention to this morning. First, developments in international affairs. Second, the arrival of new technologies.
On the former, our business plan for the next year explains that we will continue to devote a considerable part of our resources to Brexit. In total, we have identified that we need an EU withdrawal budget of some £30m. A cost that covers work to achieve operational readiness for the UK’s exit. 
... the FCA has worked to deliver its commitment to public value by keeping to an overall budget that is flat in real terms.
I think it is important to say that meeting this funding requirement has required us to take difficult decisions elsewhere.
Nonetheless, I want to stress that the FCA has worked to deliver its commitment to public value by keeping to an overall budget that is flat in real terms.
Impact of technological developments
To my second point on developments in technology, we know that innovation in areas like big data and machine learning are a test of regulators’ abilities to adapt.
The FCA generally describes itself as ‘technology neutral’. Meaning we approach the regulation of individual technologies on their merit. And I think this is the correct approach.
Technology can obviously be enormously positive. It is now integral to delivering financial advice, products and services. It can help firms manage money laundering risks. It can also reduce market entry costs for new businesses, driving greater product differentiation and competition across the market. Ultimately supporting a greater proportion of society.
But new technologies also tend to create new risks. They expose more people to problems like online fraud and misuse of data. And we recognise that they can also leave some customers behind, particularly the most vulnerable.
So how we manage this double-edged sword is extremely important. 
The FCA’s approach has been to champion useful developments in FinTech and RegTech over the last five years. Giving firms support through Project Innovate and the opportunity to test new innovations in a controlled environment – the FCA’s Sandbox.
Early results from the Sandbox show that it is starting to provide the benefits we set out to achieve. Meaning it is helping new products to be tested effectively. It has also reduced the time and cost of getting innovative ideas to market. It has improved access to finance for innovators. And it has ensured that the right safeguards are built in to new products and services.
As you might expect, this positive experience has encouraged regulators in other jurisdictions to follow our lead.
But my hope is that the number of joint innovation programmes between different countries, both formal and informal, will grow. Partly because by collaborating we can respond better to the breadth and depth of developments in financial services. And partly because innovation on a global scale requires consistent standards. 
And this brings me to my final point. As financial services have become globalised, so has financial crime.
Our serious approach to financial crime
As I say in the Annual Report, whatever shape Brexit eventually takes, maintaining and deepening our partnerships with international regulators and law enforcement agencies will remain vital.
To give you a flavour of how significant our collaboration already is, at the start of the summer we had routed some 3.1 billion transaction reports, since January, to other National Competent Authorities. A process achieved via the European transaction reporting exchange mechanism.
And it is important to stress that we cannot manage the risks of financial crime successfully unless we can share data in this way. Data sharing provides both the UK and EU countries with a vital foundation to tackle cross-border market abuse, including insider dealing and cross-market manipulation. 
But the essential point is this: if we want to reduce the human costs associated with problems like fraud and money laundering, the UK is, and must remain, an inhospitable place for financial crime. And the FCA pursues this goal by operating an extensive programme of supervisory and enforcement work.
This means we work hard to strengthen the sector’s resilience to crime through our systematic anti-money laundering programme and awareness-raising around issues like fraud. And we also conduct a significant volume of enforcement work against firms and individuals. 
So, in the last reporting period, for example, we issued 269 Final Notices, including 248 against firms, and 21 against individuals. We imposed close to £70m in financial penalties. And our count of opened and closed enforcement cases also increased significantly year-on-year.
I am also encouraged by my first impressions of the organisation’s willingness to adapt and to prioritise public value.
My own opinion is that this work demonstrates the seriousness of the FCA’s approach to financial crime and other breaches of our rules. I am also encouraged by my first impressions of the organisation’s willingness to adapt and to prioritise public value.
I also want to stress the importance of our move to new offices in Stratford, which I see as an opportunity for the FCA to work differently. Especially in terms of becoming more streamlined so that we can deliver fair outcomes fast.  
So as Chair, I will work to make sure that the FCA Board supports this ambition. And we will challenge the FCA to build on its considerable achievements to be the best it can be.
Let me end with a thank you, in advance, for your questions today. I’ll now hand over to Andrew Bailey, who will provide more detail on this year’s Annual Report.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Highlights
Brexit continues to require considerable resource and engagement with firms and other stakeholders.
The balance of the risks we have to tackle has shifted towards operational risks, including resilience, technological change and financial crime.
We continue to work on longstanding issues including RBS GRG, HBOS and Connaught.
The year in review
I’d like to take the opportunity to welcome Charles to his first APM as Chair. Charles brings with him a wealth of experience, both during the financial crisis and more recently as a member of the Prudential Regulation Committee, and so has a solid understanding of the challenges the FCA faces. It’s great to have him with us.
The FCA’s goal is to serve the public interest through our regulation of financial services in the UK. That means accountability to the public. That’s why direct engagement like this is so important.
The FCA’s goal is to serve the public interest through our regulation of financial services in the UK.
Let me start with a few of the headlines of what we have been doing over the last year.
We have continued to tackle the harms that we have found in parts of the consumer credit market, notably so-called high-cost credit. For the past four years, the FCA has been dealing with issues across a population of 30,000 consumer credit firms. This is the largest single task the FCA has undertaken in its history. Following our review of the high-cost credit market, in May we consulted on a package of measures that we expect to save consumers over £200m. We have committed to consider a cap on rent-to-own prices and fundamental changes to the way banks charge for overdrafts. We are also working with the Government and others to encourage the availability and consumer awareness of reasonably priced alternatives to high-cost credit.
We have taken major initiatives as a competition authority. Probably the most notable of these has been the Asset Management Market Study, which has tackled a broad range of issues in pricing and transparency. And, with at least £8.1 trillion of assets managed in the UK, this is not a marginal financial services activity by any means.
The major change under way around pension freedoms has had the effect of transferring much of the responsibility for pension decisions and long-term saving to individuals. Societal change and increasing life expectancy, and the impact these will have on how we manage our finances, mean there are good reasons for this. But because of their long-term nature and uncertainty, these decisions are some of the hardest consumers will have to make. So we are supporting them through initiatives like the Retirement Outcomes Review, the Financial Advice Market Review, and our supervisory work, as well as using our enforcement powers where necessary.
We have continued our remedies work around PPI, with over £30bn paid out in redress so far. There is now just under a year to go before the deadline for PPI claims. Our campaign to ensure high levels of public awareness before then has further to go therefore, which means that Arnie will be back on your screens soon.
As the UK’s financial market regulator, we have undertaken a broad programme of work over the last year, the new MiFID II EU Directive, the largest single change in financial market regulation, chief amongst it. And it was a major change; we estimated that under MiFID we will capture some 30-35 million transaction reports a day, up from 20 million before its introduction. I am pleased to report that we achieved this objective.
Ten years on from the crisis, there is no question that we saw behaviour in the past which was well below what we should expect. The regulatory regime did not create the correct incentives – emphasising individual culpability rather than the responsibility of senior people for the firm’s activities as a whole. A defence that the individual did not personally make a bad loan or mis-sell a product is not good enough. We are now implementing the new Senior Managers and Certification Regime across our landscape, extending it out from banks. This is a very important change.
We are conscious that we must strike the right balance between regulation which is robust and effective but that also enables change to occur which will benefit consumers.
We are conscious that we must strike the right balance between regulation which is robust and effective but that also enables change to occur which will benefit consumers. That’s why we put so much emphasis on the work we do with Project Innovate and our regulatory sandbox. And we are particularly pleased at the scale of international partnership and engagement with other authorities around the world seeking to promote this objective.
Lastly, the FCA maintains an active programme of work to develop our understanding of the issues consumers face. We have published our Financial Lives survey, which we believe is the most comprehensive study of UK consumers, organised by age, life cycle and region. We have also made the underlying data available for those who wish to carry out their own research using them. We intend to repeat this exercise on a regular basis so that we can see how issues change over time.
Ongoing work
I’d like to turn now to our ongoing work, and then offer some thoughts on wider implications.

I am going to start with Brexit. Our work here cuts across all parts of the FCA and requires considerable resource. To support this, and our international engagement, I am pleased that Nausicaa Delfas has taken up the post of Executive Director of International.
Our Brexit work has a number of important strands. We are working with the Government on the EU Withdrawal legislation to ensure continuity of the legal and regulatory framework after Brexit, when EU law will cease to have effect in the UK.
We are working with firms to understand their preparations.
And we are working on the design of the proposed temporary permissions regime (TPR) for EEA firms currently operating in the UK. The TPR will ensure EEA firms can operate the day after exit as they did the day before. It will also provide reassurance to consumers that the services they use will continue uninterrupted.
Our commitment to protecting consumers and to strong, open markets remains resolute – whether the UK is a member of the EU or not. So we are committed to keeping our relationships with European counterparts as close as possible, after exit and beyond. A good example of this is the reform of Libor, an important part of our market integrity objective, where the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, and I chair the international group overseeing this work.
In a letter to Andrew Tyrie, then Chair of the Treasury Select Committee, in October 2016 I set out the principles that the FCA was applying to guide its work on Brexit. These are:
Cross border market access – Open markets are an important enabler of healthy competition, supporting FCA objectives.
Support for the principle of consistent global standards where markets are also global.
Cooperation between regulatory authorities - A robust framework which provides for continued cooperation will be fundamental in enabling us to meet our objectives.
Influence over standards - The FCA should continue to play a part in shaping international standards. We must build on our existing relationships with other regulators around the world through multilateral bodies such as IOSCO and the FSB.
Opportunity to recruit and maintain a skilled workforce - Being able to recruit and retain the right people from across the world, with the right mix of skills, is important to the health of the organisation and indeed to the health of the wider UK financial sector.
They remain our guiding principles.
In particular, I would emphasise that we believe our objectives are best achieved in open financial markets where there is respect for the autonomy of domestic regulation, but where the outcomes of that regulation respect those international standards. This in turn provides a foundation for open markets. There is nothing new about this: Brexit does not require the international system to be reinvented. But I would re-emphasise a point I have made many times: that in the wake of the financial crisis it would have been easy to respond by closing financial markets in a bid to insulate the domestic economy and financial institutions, and ultimately consumers. That would have been a huge mistake. Now is not the time to go back on the commitment to open markets, and I am pleased that there are many authorities around the world who share our position.
Looking back over the last decade there has been a very clear shift in the balance of risks that we have to tackle. We are still dealing with the consequences of some of these risks – I have already mentioned PPI and Libor reform. And, more deeply, we are still dealing with the major loss of public confidence in the financial system. But today we face a new source of risk to our objectives, which I would describe under the umbrella heading of operational risks. Let me draw out four themes.
Operational resilience
First, there is operational resilience and the consequences of its loss. This can take broadly two forms: cyber-risk, which involves the threat from outside actors seeking to disrupt firms and systems; and second, the risks that arise from the greater complexity of operational platforms in firms which can, as we have seen, lead to disruption for consumers. The impact of this type of risk is all the greater in an environment where consumers rely more on machines than human contact with firms. The FCA has an important role in these areas and we have increased our resources to reflect the risk.
Technological change and innovation
The second area is the impact of technological change and innovation. As I said earlier, the FCA is firmly a supporter of innovation, but we must balance this against the threats that come from some forms of innovation and the new issues they can pose. A good example of this is cryptoassets. We are keen to see the potential of their underlying technology, and do not rule out roles for cryptoassets themselves. But the risks are evident too: not least in the question of whether the consumers who use them understand the asset and price volatility they involve. We are working closely with the Treasury and Bank of England to assess these issues and come up with appropriate responses.
Financial crime
This brings me to the third operational challenge, financial crime; a constant priority that sees us working with other authorities both here and abroad. Last year we received 1,064 requests for information and investigatory assistance from over 80 different regulatory and law enforcement authorities in 63 countries. We also worked closely with colleagues on a number of high profile cases, including against Beaufort Securities, an operation that we conducted in tandem with the US Department of Justice, as well as regulatory colleagues in Canada and Germany. This year saw the Office for Professional Body Anti-Money Laundering Supervision come into force. OPBAS, which is housed in the FCA, allows for better collaboration and information sharing between relevant authorities, supporting us in our aim to make the UK financial markets hostile to criminals.
Through our ScamSmart campaign, we’ve also focused this year on increasing consumer awareness around the risks of fraud.
Data
The last broad operational risk I want to highlight concerns data. My assessment based on events over the last year or so is that data issues have been the fastest rising risk on our landscape. They take two forms. The first involves loss of personal data belonging to customers, whether caused by harmful actions such as cyber-attacks or due to mismanagement of data and negligence by firms.
The second involves how firms use personal data, and whether this is consistent with our rules and principles. Of course, data issues are by no means restricted to financial services, and nor are they necessarily at their worst in our regulated world. But the heavy use of personal data to determine suitable products and services is inherent to financial services, so this issue is high up our agenda.
Longstanding issues
I’d now like to turn to the longstanding issues we continue to work on.
RBS
First, to RBS.
In July, we published an update on our investigation into RBS’ treatment of SME customers transferred to its Global Restructuring Group (GRG).
Given the serious concerns that were identified in the independent review it was only right that we launched an investigation to see if we could take any action against senior management or RBS.
It is important to recognise, however, that the business of GRG was largely unregulated and the FCA’s powers in such circumstances are therefore very limited. After considering all the evidence we concluded that our powers to discipline for misconduct did not apply and that any action in relation to senior management would not have reasonable prospects of success. Because of the importance of the issue, we had this conclusion ratified by independent senior counsel.
I recognise the frustration this decision caused to GRG customers, but I’d like to make clear that we explored all the options available to us before arriving at this conclusion.
I would also add that the fact that we cannot take action on this occasion in no way condones the behaviour of RBS, whose treatment of GRG customers fell well short of what we expect to see.
In terms of next steps, we will publish a fuller account of our findings as soon as we are able to do so.
And we are closely monitoring the complaints process overseen by Sir William Blackburne, an independent third party.
HBOS
Turning to HBOS, as many of you will be aware, there are two cases here; the one concerning individuals that came out of the main report and the Reading case.
On the former, the review into why HBOS failed, published in 2015, concluded that the ultimate responsibility for HBOS’ failure rested with the Board and senior management of the firm. The FCA and PRA then began joint investigations into the conduct of certain former senior managers of HBOS. We have gathered a substantial amount of information from many sources. We were informed earlier this year of a number of further potentially relevant documents, which we are obtaining and reviewing as a matter of priority.
In parallel, we are conducting an evidential and legal analysis of relevant information, and this will continue. We cannot reach any conclusions until the evidence review process is complete.
We recognise that there is considerable public interest in these investigations. We have committed significant resources and time to ensure these matters are properly investigated and are treating them as a priority. Investigations like these, into events that took place a number of years ago, can take longer than is often appreciated. We are, though, committed to completing them as soon as possible. It is, however, frustrating that certain parties have determined to reveal the existence of more documentation at such a late stage.
On Reading, last year we announced that we were recommencing an investigation into the events surrounding the discovery of misconduct within the HBOS Reading unit. This resumes an investigation that was put on hold in 2013 at the request of Thames Valley Police, pending the outcome of their investigation and prosecutions.
The FCA’s investigation is focusing on the extent and nature of the knowledge of these matters within HBOS and its communications with the Financial Services Authority after the initial discovery of the misconduct.
We have gathered over 140,000 documents and conducted targeted electronic searches to identify a specific sub-set of documents from this population. The team has reviewed around 35,000 documents and undertaken analysis of the interviews with former HBOS employees conducted to date.
We are nearing the end of our investigative review and considering what action is appropriate. The timings for the completion of our review are subject to any additional relevant material being identified within the records that are still being provided to the HBOS individuals investigation.
Connaught
Now to turn to Connaught. In November, we announced that we had secured redress for the investors who suffered loss.
The aim of the payment is to return the amount originally invested, putting investors, as far as possible, back into the position they would have been in if they had never invested in the fund.
Redress statements have been sent to investors and for most cases we expect to begin payment to investors within 60 days of issuing the redress letter.
Capita Financial Managers Limited (CFM) has been publicly censured and will pay up to £66mn to the investors affected.
Interest rate hedging products (IRHPs)
Lastly, on interest rate hedging products (IRHPs), review work is largely completed and over £2 billion has been paid out in redress. As relevant legal proceedings have not concluded, the lessons learnt exercise has not yet started, though we are undertaking preparatory work.
Running of the FCA
Let me finish with a few points on the running of the FCA. I want to start by thanking all of my colleagues, both the senior management team here today and all FCA staff for the dedication and skill they bring to our work. Our regulation covers a very large landscape of financial services, which calls for a very big commitment from all colleagues. Let me also thank the FCA Board for their support and advice.
Our regulation covers a very large landscape of financial services, which calls for a very big commitment from all colleagues.
This summer has seen us move to our new home in Stratford. The immediate reason for the move was that after twenty years in Canary Wharf the lease expired. Stratford offers better value for money than the alternatives considered by the Board a few years ago. For the first time in a long while, all our London staff are in the same building, and I believe this will bring opportunities for how we work.
We also have an office in Edinburgh, a long-standing presence, with around 100 staff. Almost a year ago, Maggie Craig took up her role as Head of Department, Scotland – a new role designed to develop the FCA’s presence in Scotland and help us engage more, and more consistently, with local stakeholders.
But our engagement around the country is not limited to Scotland. Between my ExCo colleagues and I, we visited 26 different places last year, travelling all around the country. From Leicester to Belfast, Nottingham to Sunderland, we’ve met with charities, community groups, firms, local councils and universities. In Manchester at the launch of our Financial Lives geographical report, for example, I heard from charities who help to get homeless people back on their feet. These conversations give us invaluable insight into the diversity of experience of the consumers we protect and help us design better regulation.
Meanwhile, our Live & Local programme has continued apace. In the 2017-18 programme, we travelled across all regions of the UK with events for retail investment, general insurance and mortgage firms.
We are back out on the road next week for the 2018-19 programme, including events for payments firms for the first time.
So now to the most important part of today’s meeting – the question and answer section. But before doing so, and in anticipation, thank you once again for coming along and making your views heard.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Highlights
It would be a mistake to move away from open financial markets as they are needed to support trade in goods and services.
A commitment to cross-border cooperation allows for standards to be set domestically where international standards do not exist.
Some in the EU are suggesting that EU financial activity must take place in the EU, at a time when other countries internationally are removing unnecessary location policies.
It is a great pleasure to be speaking at Eurofi and to comment on the topic of multilateralism and global coordination which is so fundamentally important right now.
I strongly believe that competition and innovation in financial markets, supported by robust regulatory and supervisory standards provide better outcomes for users of financial services, particularly so in wholesale markets. An essential pre-requisite of these outcomes in my view is open financial markets which also support trade in goods and services.
As authorities from around the world we work together to develop and implement standards which are strong but flexible enough to enable competition and innovation. It would have been easy to turn our backs on open markets in the wake of the searing experience of the financial crisis, but to the great credit of everyone involved that did not happen. 
Unfortunately, there is regular commentary that this approach is now being challenged.  This would be a mistake.
It has always been the case that one jurisdiction cannot constrain the autonomy of another’s domestic regulation (and here I treat the Single Market as one jurisdiction). But it would be a big, and in my view unfortunate, leap to therefore say that we cannot envisage open financial markets which support free trade - and to suggest that we cannot underpin open markets with a common commitment to international standards where they exist. Such a commitment to international standards is an essential part of achieving equivalent outcomes and thereby managing risks which go across borders. But also where international standards do not exist, freedom for jurisdictions to set their own standards domestically can certainly co-exist with international co-operation in a way that enables agreed equivalence of outcomes. 
where international standards do not exist, freedom for jurisdictions to set their own standards domestically can certainly co-exist with international co-operation in a way that enables agreed equivalence of outcomes.
Let me give two important examples of where we are balancing these considerations today.
First, on benchmark interest-rate reform.  There is no constraint on domestic choices on the alternative and risk-free rate to be chosen for each currency. Different choices have been made for different currencies. But that does not remove the need for, or prevent, strong co-operation to co-ordinate the outcomes based on those choices.
Second, on financial innovation and regulatory ‘sandboxes’: there is no constraint on any domestic choice on the model for sandboxes or what is accepted into them. These are all rightly domestic choices shaped by domestic circumstances and demand. But that should not prevent co-operation to in order to enable cross-border activity where appropriate. To do otherwise would make no sense. That is why we in the FCA set up a Global Financial Innovation Network which will help pool regulatory expertise to support firms in trialling innovative cross-border services and products. And it is why The International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) launched a FinTech Network to explore the effective use of regulation in financial technology and automation.
Closer to home, going forward next year, there will be areas where UK authorities will need to closely coordinate with the EU, the US and others whilst each managing our autonomy - and respecting the autonomy of others.  To offer just one particular example: The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II has been calibrated based on UK and EU27 markets combined and it may not make sense to break that down and have different UK and EU transparency rules for the same products.
When I speak to other regulators, I get a clear sense of a common interest to preserve the benefits of collaboration, sharing of information, and to ensuring effective supervision. But there is evidently a debate on this as we think about the post-Brexit situation.
One perspective is the desire to keep access to the Single Market open to third countries, including the UK, on the basis of open markets, equivalent standards and the right of establishment.
I strongly welcome Commissioner Chris Giancarlo of The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) proposals for closer cross border cooperation and a greater use of deference – reliance on comparable overseas rules – where they deliver broadly equivalent outcomes.
Another is that financial activity involving EU parties should be carried out as far as possible in the EU.  But this seems to go against the principle of open markets and free trade, and is unnecessary in view of all the post-crisis work on co-operation and broad alignment of standards.
Moreover, other countries are moving in the direction to remove unnecessary location policies and national treatments. To this end, I strongly welcome Commissioner Chris Giancarlo of The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) proposals for closer cross border cooperation and a greater use of deference – reliance on comparable overseas rules – where they deliver broadly equivalent outcomes.
In Europe, as we will have identical frameworks, there will be a strong case for the UK and the EU to find each other equivalent on ‘day 1’.
In my view, the real strength of deeper capital markets is access to a global pool of capital to support the growth of companies and economies. Consistent outcomes of regulation are what matters, reinforced by strong regulatory co-operation and co-ordination - which is essential to preserve the strength of the global financial system. In Europe, as we will have identical frameworks, there will be a strong case for the UK and the EU to find each other equivalent on ‘day 1’. And we should now work together to put in place the arrangements to achieve this in practice. By committing to this course, together we can also take a decisive step to head off the risk of transitional cliff edges. 
I have previously argued that there are four key elements of such strong regulatory co-ordination: comparability of rules (but not exact mirroring), supervisory co-ordination, exchange of information, and a mechanism to deal with differences.
I see an emphasis on outcomes-based equivalence as fundamentally important to support the balance between autonomy and co-operation and avoid outcomes that will damage the economic well-being and successful financial markets. There has been a lot of debate around the use of the word ‘mutual’ in the context of the Brexit debate.  ‘Mutual’ does not involve constraining domestic autonomy: rather, it involves approaches which should deliver broadly equivalent outcomes while respecting the autonomy of jurisdictions. This should facilitate the benefits of open markets, the thing we should all value and work hard to preserve.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority
Ten years after Lehman: how accountants can make finance safer,Speeches,06/09/2018,06/09/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/ten-years-after-lehman-how-accountants-can-make-finance-safer,"Speaker: Charles Randell, Chair, Financial Conduct Authority and Payment Systems RegulatorLocation: ICAEW Canary Wharf Members’ ClubDelivered on: 6 September 2018

The financial crisis raised a fundamental question for the accounting profession and for others: what are financial statements for?
Ten years on from the height of the financial storm is a good moment to reflect on whether we have answered that fundamental question.

Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version.
On this day 10 years ago, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 2 enormous engines driving real estate loan markets in the United States, were put into conservatorship and effectively taken over by the Federal Government. Nine days later, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. Numerous other firms then failed and either entered insolvency processes or were bailed out by governments. It’s often been said that the financial crisis caused lasting damage to our economy and that in the austerity which followed, the living standards of millions of people fell. But behind the economic statistics lie tragedies of individual loss: loss of employment, loss of savings, loss of mental or physical health and, in some cases, loss of life.
Most if not all of the firms which failed had been reporting relatively robust financial positions right up to the point when they did fail, with financial statements signed off by their boards and large audit firms. 
So the financial crisis raised a fundamental question for the accounting profession and for others: what are financial statements for? 
Ten years on from the height of the financial storm is a good moment to reflect on whether we have answered that fundamental question, and to think about how accountants can make finance safer.
Accounting and the FCA
Why is accounting relevant to the mission of the FCA? There are at least 4 reasons.
The FCA is a prudential regulator: first, the FCA is a prudential regulator.  Although the capital requirements of some 1,500 banks, insurance companies and large investment firms are set by the Prudential Regulation Authority, there are over 18,000 solo-regulated firms whose capital requirements are set by the FCA, including the country’s biggest asset managers and investment platforms. Good quality financial statements are a key building block of effective prudential regulation of these firms.
Accounting metrics drive incentives of management and shareholders: secondly, metrics from financial statements, such as return on capital or earnings per share, drive the incentives, and therefore conduct, of management and shareholders. Both management and shareholders have reasons to want firms to take on more risk, because they have limited exposure to the downside. The financial statements may be accompanied by disclosures about risks that have not yet crystallised but, generally speaking, they do not try to adjust reported results for risk. Both management and shareholders are sometimes long gone by the time that the potential risks to a firm’s business model become actual threats to its survival. We see clearly now that in the years leading up to the financial crisis these lopsided incentives drove risky business models. Customers suffered, as firms mis-sold products in their search for growth and returns; the crisis was a crisis of misconduct and not just a prudential crisis. By 2017, the global banking industry alone had paid out over $320bn in fines worldwide for misconduct, and the amount continues to grow.
Poor accounting records can cause consumer harm: thirdly, firm failure can leave customers high and dry. They may lose their savings and, even if they do not, they may face delays in getting their money back. Firms should be financially resilient. But in a competitive market some firms will still fail, and when they do, the loss and disruption caused by their failure must be minimised. This means having good quality records which support rapid valuations and payouts, reducing not just losses to individual customers but also the risk of contagion throughout the financial system.
Financial disclosure is a necessary condition of markets that work well: finally, the FCA has a strategic objective of ensuring that markets work well. To work well, markets need good quality disclosure, including financial disclosure. As the UK Listing Authority, the FCA also has specific functions in respect of the continuing disclosure obligations of listed firms. We saw during the crisis that when the market lost confidence in firms’ financial statements, the result was illiquid and volatile markets, with market participants relying more than usual on their own guesstimates.
I would like to talk about the role of accountants in supporting the FCA’s objectives, and making finance safer, under four headings:
what are financial statements for?
the importance of business model analysis
client asset record-keeping
the relationship between accountants and regulators
What are financial statements for?
The financial crisis posed the fundamental question: what are financial statements for?
The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting states that the objective of general purpose financial reporting is to provide financial information that helps users take decisions about providing resources to the reporting entity. It adopts the principle of neutrality and measures assets at either their historical cost or their value at the reporting date. 
There’s been much debate about whether financial reporting standards added to financial instability through their procyclical effects, as current values followed the cycle up and then fell when it turned. Without entering that debate, it seems clear to me that the financial cycle has a significant effect on most financial firms, and that many users of a financial firm’s statements are more interested in what is likely to happen to the firm in the future than what happened in the past.  Neither historical cost nor current value, the two measurement principles of IFRS, will fully meet their needs. 
In the more immediate aftermath of the crisis, the FSA’s Turner Review in 2009 proposed that published accounts should also include buffers which anticipate potential future losses, through, for instance, the creation of an ‘Economic Cycle Reserve’. The Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards concluded that for banks there should be a separate set of accounts for regulators drawn up on the basis of prudence rather than neutrality, which should be externally audited and might be published alongside the IFRS accounts, together with a reconciliation of the two statements.
Neither of these proposals has been adopted, although to a certain extent, IFRS 9 addresses the limitations of the historical cost and current value approaches. Going forward, firms will need to provide for one year of expected credit losses when financial instruments are acquired or created.  Those provisions will need to be increased to include lifetime expected losses when there is a significant adverse change in circumstances. This is a step towards giving users of financial statements greater confidence in firms’ reported numbers, which many analysts lost after the onset of the financial crisis. It’s now up to the accounting profession to make IFRS 9 work and, critically, to ensure that the standard is applied in such a way that investors can make meaningful comparisons between different firms.
However, the continuing limitations of the historical cost or current value approach of financial reporting standards lead to regulatory requirements for financial firms to keep what amounts to multiple sets of books.  This is, to put it mildly, not ideal: I spent part of my summer break reading Dan Davies’s very entertaining book about fraud, ‘Lying for Money’ in which he describes numerous scams involving the keeping of two sets of books. But for many financial firms, accounting standard setters and regulators effectively require three sets of, I should stress, legitimately prepared books:
First, the financial statements present the results and financial position of the entity for the reporting period, generally based on current market circumstances, adopting the principle of neutrality.
Secondly, regulators then require a set of regulatory capital numbers to capitalise the entity on the basis of assumed levels of risk in their assets and operations reflecting, we hope, a more prudent view of the risk of future losses.  
And thirdly, regulators then require a further set of numbers to be prepared based on severe but plausible stress scenarios. For FCA solo-regulated firms, this is done through the firm’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process. On the basis of this further set of numbers, the FCA sets individual capital guidance for firms.
How should we feel about this?  I would make three points.
First, and most importantly, the audited financial statements of a financial firm are the cornerstone on which the additional regulatory processes are built. For that reason, we need accountants to deliver high quality audited financial statements for firms. It was, therefore, very disappointing to see that the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) announcement of its 2017/18 Audit Quality Review highlighted a decline in the audit quality for the Big Four audit firms and specifically a decline in the quality of bank audits.  Whatever the outcome of the current review of the Financial Reporting Council which is being undertaken by Sir John Kingman, the profession needs to address audit quality as a matter of urgency.
…the profession needs to address audit quality as a matter of urgency.
Secondly, high quality auditing requires robust scepticism and challenge from auditors. Bringing this scepticism and challenge to bear is the core purpose of audit. The accounting profession needs to step up its game here, including ensuring that it benefits from — and matches — the scepticism and challenge inherent in the regulatory capital setting process. Disclosures in the financial statements should properly reflect the risks which are revealed by that process, including the ICAAP or other stress scenarios. It is perhaps an interesting thought experiment to ask whether, if the regulatory capital numbers were subject to external audit, that would increase the focus of auditors on these risks.
And thirdly, it seems to me that the current approach of financial reporting standards — in particular the neutrality principle and the lack of forward looking risk measurement — makes it inevitable that the financial statements of firms will not be sufficient for regulators to do their job in setting capital.  However, it also seems to me desirable that the information asymmetries between firms, their investors and creditors and their regulators should be limited to the minimum necessary. Information asymmetries increase agency problems between a firm’s management and its investors, they reduce the effectiveness of market discipline and they can lead to moral hazard.
Some of the information asymmetries I have referred to have been addressed by the public disclosure of the stress test results of the largest banks and changes in the policy on disclosure of banks’ total capital requirements.
However, this leaves some categories of firms, including FCA solo-regulated firms, where the full amount of capital the regulator deems they should hold, including the additional capital they need to meet stress scenarios, is not transparent to the market. We should continue to debate whether this is satisfactory, and whether financial statements or other disclosures can provide more transparency about the risks an entity may face in a range of plausible future scenarios.
The importance of business model analysis
One of the key lessons of the financial crisis was that good quality corporate reporting and auditing needs to start with the firm’s business model: how the firm generates economic value. In the years leading up to the crisis, we lost sight of what financial firms were for. It’s now clear that to create economic value sustainably, firms need a clear understanding of their purpose and how they ensure they achieve good outcomes for their customers. Since the financial crisis, regulators also start by analysing a firm’s business model when they are deciding their supervisory strategy. 
Quoted companies have had to disclose their business model since 2013. Good business model disclosures are the foundations of a firm’s strategic reporting, and should in turn drive disclosures about performance indicators and risk. Firms should link their remuneration policies to these performance indicators and risks. And the accounting policies should be appropriate to the business model.
Coupled with the long-term viability statement, which quoted companies are now required to include in their corporate reporting, these reforms provide companies with an opportunity to set out how, why and for whom they create value, and the longer-term threats to this model.
I think it is fair to say, firstly, that business model disclosure and the long-term viability statement have not yet reached maturity in all quoted financial firms and, secondly, that firms to which these requirements do not apply have not all recognised the benefits of voluntarily adopting them as best practice.  The accounting profession can help to guide firms to put business model analysis and consideration of long-term viability at the heart of their corporate reporting. 
Client asset record-keeping
The aim of financial statements drawn up on a going concern basis is to reflect the value of assets, liabilities and earnings streams that would continue to be enjoyed if the firm stayed in business. But the regulator tends focus on what happens when all is not well — particularly the point at which the firm is likely to fail and the consequences of the firm’s failure.
As well as recording their own assets and liabilities, the investment businesses we regulate must maintain records of the money and investments they are holding on behalf of their clients. The accuracy of these records is vital to ensure that if they fail, the client money and assets they hold can be returned promptly to clients. We have detailed rules on how to keep and reconcile these records and we also require firms to arrange for an independent audit of compliance with these obligations.
Auditor reporting on client assets has improved significantly over the last five years, particularly after the introduction in January 2016 of the FRC Standard on Providing Assurance on Client Assets to the FCA.
However, the FCA remains concerned that some audit firms have not invested sufficiently in building their knowledge and understanding of the Client Asset Sourcebook (CASS) Rules and the FRC Standard. We continue to see Client Assets reports that are just not good enough.
We continue to see Client Assets reports that are just not good enough.
Our rules require senior management to take reasonable steps to ensure that their CASS auditor has the required skill, resources and experience to perform its functions — and this is a continuing requirement. The obligation we place on firms is additional to the requirements on the auditors themselves, under their own professional standards, to ensure that they are competent to carry out their work.
We continue to monitor this area but be warned: we have a very low tolerance for CASS failings, because of the significant customer detriment these can cause, and we expect auditors to identify CASS failings when they report to us.
The relationship between accountants and regulators
Which brings me on to my final point.The relationship between accountants and regulators since the financial crisis has not always been easy.
Formally, our expectations are set out in the FCA Finalised Guidance 13/3 Code of Practice for the relationship between the external auditor and the supervisor’. However, a relationship does not work well just because it is set down in a Code of Practice. It takes hard work on both sides and requires both sides to listen to problems and resolve them. So as the (relatively) new chair of the FCA and Payment Systems Regulator, I would like to assure you that I am happy to get feedback, good or bad, on the functioning of the regulator/auditor relationship and suggestions to improve it.
I would single out firm culture as a particularly important point to discuss in this relationship. It’s clear that it’s one of the most important drivers of conduct outcomes for a firm. The auditors will have a clear view of the culture of the firm they audit, based on the extent to which senior and junior management accept challenge, allow discussion and give straight answers. The effectiveness of the relationship between the executive and the board, and in particular the relationship with the audit committee, is generally a good indicator of culture, as is the extent to which firms empower and take heed of their risk and internal audit functions.
...we need to continue to debate whether financial statements or other disclosures can provide better guidance about future risks and reduce the information asymmetries which still exist between management, investors and creditors and regulators.
Conclusion
Ten years on from the start of the financial crisis, there’s still much more to be done to ensure that accountants in general, and auditors in particular, play their part in supporting markets that function well. This requires high quality audited financial statements, based on well-articulated and sustainable business models.
The accounting profession needs to ensure that firms embed the changes which have been introduced since the financial crisis, including disclosure and analysis of business models and long-term viability and consistent and comparable reporting of credit loss provisions. 
But after that we need to continue to debate whether financial statements or other disclosures can provide better guidance about future risks and reduce the information asymmetries which still exist between management, investors and creditors and regulators. 
However good the financial statement disclosures may become, in a competitive market some firms will still fail. Accountants also have an important role to play in ensuring that firms have good quality records, including records of client assets, so that they can fail safely.
And finally, auditors and regulators share many common objectives and need to ensure that their relationship is open and effective and that auditors share with us their insights into the culture of the firm they audit.
If together we can deliver all of this, then accountants will have helped to make finance safer for everyone.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Regulated retail investment adviser re-evaluation,Statements,05/09/2018,21/09/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/regulated-retail-investment-adviser-re-evaluation,"We have collaborated with the Chartered Insurance Institute (CII) to create a re-assessment test of the level 4 Diploma in Financial Planning. The CII will make the ‘Regulated Retail Investment Adviser Re-Evaluation’ available from 1 October 2018 and the assessment aims to raise the standards and competence of Financial Advisers. There are also other bodies which offer relevant level 4 qualifications. We are working with some of them in creating their own re-evaluation tests and writing to others to invite them to do the same.
We believe that advisers having a good level of knowledge is the foundation to giving sound financial advice. This is particularly the case with the more technical aspects of financial advice.
The level 4 Diploma became the standard when the Retail Distribution Review came into force at the start of 2013. Advisers complete a minimum of 35 hours continuous professional development each year with the aim of maintaining their knowledge. Not all firms test their advisers’ knowledge yearly as part of their Statement of Professional Standing, with many advisers never retesting.
The objective of the re-evaluation is to identify areas of strength and weakness in technical knowledge and its application that underpins suitable financial advice. While there is no FCA requirement for advisors periodically to sit such a test, professional development can identify areas of strength and weakness in technical knowledge and its application that underpins suitable financial advice.
We will encourage firms to use it and we may also use it as a supervisory tool if we think it is appropriate to ask firms to re-test specific advisers.

Five sentenced in FCA prosecution of £2.8m investment fraud,Press Releases,04/09/2018,04/09/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/five-sentenced-fca-prosecution-28m-investment-fraud,"In a case brought by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), 5 individuals have been sentenced to a total of 17.5 years’ imprisonment for their roles in a share fraud carried out through a series of boiler room companies which led to the loss of more than £2.8m of investors’ money.
The sentencing of 5 defendants was concluded today at Southwark Crown Court. The sixth defendant, Michael Nascimento (DOB 28 June 1977), will be sentenced on the 14 September 2018. He was the controlling mind, instigator and the main beneficiary of the fraud.
Commenting on the case, Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:
“These fraudsters callously targeted investors who were often elderly and vulnerable, lying to them to get them to part with significant sums of money. Despite efforts to conceal and destroy evidence, the FCA, in one of its largest ever investigations, was able to ensure that these criminals faced justice and ended up behind bars.
Applications under Proceeds of Crime legislation remain on foot and the FCA is determined to recover as much money from these defendants as possible for the benefit of investors.'
Vulnerable victims targeted
In sentencing the defendants, the trial judge, His Honour Judge Hehir, remarked these were “scams from start to finish' and that “some victims have lost everything they had.' He also added that it was “particularly repellent' that elderly people had been specifically targeted and their stories “were at times positively heart-breaking.'
The Judge also said “..none of the victims chose to be swindled, others chose to swindle them. No victim of these sort of offences should blame themselves. Those who commit these offences cannot expect anything but firm punishment.'
Charanjit Sandhu (DOB 3 December 1989) was sentenced to 5.5 years’ imprisonment. He was a senior broker, often using bullying sales tactics and false names. The Judge commented that he was “dazzled by the rewards of crime' and had “lost his moral compass'. In terms of two of the investors he said that Mr Sandhu “had pestered them mercilessly by telephone' and that his conduct was “cruel and callous' and “chilling'.
Hugh Edwards (DOB 13 July 1982) was sentenced to 3 years and 9 months’ imprisonment. He recruited and trained brokers, drafted and sent misleading brochures to potential investors, and personally pitched the product as a senior broker using false names.
Stuart Rea (DOB 12th February 1968) was sentenced to 3 years and 9 months’ imprisonment. He fronted one of the companies, recruited and managed the sales brokers, and circulated the misleading promotional material.
Jeannine Lewis (DOB 15 September 1967) was sentenced to 2.5 years’ imprisonment. As PA to Nascimento she assisted him to launder the proceeds of the fraud through various bank accounts including her own. She hid and destroyed documents and computers to prevent them falling into the hands of FCA investigators. The Judge described Mrs Lewis as “Michael Nascimento’s devoted personal assistant' and that she was “in truth a thoroughly dishonest woman.'
Ryan Parker (DOB 26 November 1992) was sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment to be suspended for 18 months. He was also ordered to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work. He fronted two of the boiler rooms for Nascimento and his personal bank accounts were used as a conduit for some of the money. His sentence was suspended by the Judge due to his age and personal mitigation and lower level of involvement. The Judge said that Mr Parker had “been exploited in a significant way by Michael Nascimento'.
The six defendants were charged by the FCA with offences of conspiracy to defraud, fraud, money laundering and perverting the course of justice, as well as breaches of FSMA, and either pleaded guilty or were convicted by the jury. Sandhu, Edwards and Rea were also made subject to Serious Crime Prevention Orders, and are prohibited from involvement in financial services or the sale of any form of investment for a period of 5 years after release from prison. Sandhu, Rea, Edwards and Parker are also banned from being company directors for periods of between 7 and 14 years.
Overview of the facts
Between July 2010 and April 2014, members of the public were cold-called and subjected to high pressure sales tactics to persuade them to purchase shares in a company that owned land on the island of Madeira. The investors were told that the value of the shares would increase substantially when permission to build 20 villas was granted, thereby enhancing the land’s value. Investors were promised guaranteed returns of between 125% and 228%. None were ever paid.
Potential investors were persuaded to purchase the shares by numerous lies: (i) the schemes were partnered with Barclays Bank; (ii) planning permission had been obtained for the 20 villas; (iii) that there was a guaranteed share buy-back; (iv) the Four Seasons or Hilton Hotel chains had agreed to buy the completed development for £43m. None of this was true and Barclays and the hotel chains had no involvement in the fraud.
Investors’ money was used to maintain the fraud and particularly to fund the lifestyle of Nascimento. Over 170 members of the public invested over £2.8m in the shares.  Many were elderly or vulnerable, and lost life-changing sums, in some cases all their life savings.
The shares were sold through 5 different companies: Morgan Forbes (UK) Ltd, First Capital Wealth Ltd, Bishops of Mayfair Ltd, Wallberg Dillion Reid Ltd and Sterling Capital Corporation Ltd.
Notes to editors:
This was one of the FCA’s most complex fraud investigations, and the first FCA prosecution of an offence of perverting the course of justice. It involved:
4 separate search operations and one unannounced visit
Seizure of over 100 computers and other digital devices
4 million documents and (after de-duplication) over 1.4 million documents ingested into the FCA’s Evidence Management System requiring evidential assessment and review.
142 witnesses
287 witness statements (2,406 pages)
3,682 exhibits (23,642 pages)
3 defendants remanded in custody for breach of court bail by committing further offences.
On 1 April 2013, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

Dina Devalia and Peter Hart of PFK Geoffrey Martin & Co. have been appointed as joint administrators.
Customers impacted by the administration of Premier FX Limited should contact the firm by emailing [email protected], or by contacting Brooke Overton-Yorke on 020 7495 1100. Alternatively customers can write to:

Please note, as a money remittance service, Premier FX Limited’s activities are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).
The FCA will continue to supervise Premier FX Limited in administration and is in close contact with the administrators. Premier FX Limited is authorised by the FCA under the Payment Services Regulations (PSRs) 2017 to provide money remittance services. Our website includes further information on what it means to be authorised under the PSRs and our approach to supervising firms.
What happened to Premier FX
Premier FX is a payment services firm which is authorised and supervised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to perform money remittance services under the Payment Services Regulations 2017 (PSRs). On 13 August 2018, on the application of the FCA, the High Court appointed two insolvency practitioners from PKF Geoffrey Martin & Co as administrators in respect of Premier FX.
Why the FCA took this action
The FCA took action to apply to the Court to apply for the insolvency of Premier FX because, following the death of the sole director and shareholder the firm was not able to pay its debts as they fell due and was cash flow insolvent.
We are very concerned that there was criminal activity taking place at Premier FX in relation to missing funds. We are investigating the business undertaken by Premier FX and will take action against any individuals we find to have broken the law in order to return money to customers of the firm
Who the administrators are
On 13 August 2018, the High Court appointed Peter Hart and Dina Devalia of PKF Geoffrey Martin & Co as joint administrators of Premier FX.

The FCA’s role in supervising Premier FX
Many firms, such as Premier FX, provide both regulated (money remittance) and unregulated (foreign exchange) services to consumers. The FCA is only responsible for supervising a firm’s regulated activities.
Although in administration, Premier FX continues to be regulated by the FCA. We are liaising with the administrators with regard to the fair treatment of Premier FX’s customers.
The provision of payment services (such as money remittance) is a regulated activity under the Payment Services Regulations 2017 (PSRs). The FCA is responsible for granting UK firms permission to undertake payment services. Firms  are either ‘registered’ or ‘authorised’ by the FCA depending on the size of their business activities.
Once a firm is granted permission, the FCA is responsible for supervising the regulated activities of that firm. We currently supervise 58,000 firms in the UK. Our approach to individual firms depends on their size, activity and potential harm to consumers. More information on how we supervise firms can be found in our Approach to Supervision.
Premier FX has been authorised and supervised by the FCA under the PSRs since 25 February 2011 to provide money remittance services.
Will I get my money back?
Any client who paid money to Premier FX and the money was not sent to the recipient in accordance with the client’s instruction will have a claim against Premier FX. The administrators are working to assess the money available to reimburse claims made. Any customers who have not yet made a claim should do so using the administrators contact details below.  
You can contact the administrators directly by emailing [email protected], by contacting Brooke Overton-Yorke on 020 7495 1100, or by writing to:

Why the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) does not apply
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) only applies to certain types of activity. This does not include money remittance, the only activity for which Premier FX Limited is authorised to undertake. The FSCS also does not apply to activities for which a firm is not authorised by the FCA to undertake.
What happens next
Premier FX’s administrators, PKF Geoffrey Martin & Co, are responsible for managing customer claims against the firm.
The administrators were appointed on 13 August 2018 and are required to provide a report to creditors within 8 weeks of their appointment. The report will provide details of Premier FX’s history and the administrator’s proposals
If you have any questions regarding the administration process, please contact them directly by emailing [email protected], by contacting Brooke Overton-Yorke on 020 7495 1100, or by writing to:
PKF Geoffrey Martin & Co.

Alongside the administrators we will continue to assess the business undertaken by Premier FX and will consider any available actions where appropriate. As this matter is on-going, we’re unable to provide further detail or comment at this time and would recommend you continue to check the News section of our website for any updates.
Do I need to use a third party to get my money back?
We are aware that some companies have been approaching customers of Premier FX, offering to help them recover their money. You should proceed with caution if you are approached by one of these companies. For the vast majority of Premier FX’s clients, there is no benefit in involving a third party in making a claim.

FCA proposes changes to rules for crowdfunding platforms,Press Releases,27/07/2018,27/07/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-proposes-changes-rules-crowdfunding-platforms,"The changes the FCA is proposing are designed to address the ways in which the loan-based crowdfunding model has developed since the FCA last reviewed the sector in December 2016. The FCA has observed the variety of loan-based crowdfunding business models, some of which have become increasingly complex.
Based on its findings the FCA is now inviting responses to a number of specific proposals to change the rules for loan-based firms which cover:
Proposals to ensure investors receive clear and accurate information about a potential investment and understand the risks involved
Ensure investors are adequately remunerated for the risk they are taking
Transparent and robust systems for assessing the risk, value and price of loans, and fair/transparent charges to investors
Promote good governance and orderly business practices
Proposals to extend existing marketing restrictions for investment-based crowdfunding platforms to loan-based platforms
In its December 2016 statement, the FCA also committed to addressing a potential gap in protections for customers buying a mortgage or taking out a home finance product through loan-based crowdfunding. The FCA is now proposing to apply rules which would normally apply to home finance providers, to P2P platforms where at least one of the investors is not an authorised home finance provider.
By contrast, for investment-based crowdfunding platforms, detailed regulatory obligations already exist to manage the risk of investment business (typically under Markets in Financial Instruments Directive or Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, and in the FCA Handbook).
The FCA has also observed some poor practice by some firms in the crowdfunding sector, particularly among loan-based platforms. This has arisen as a result of both poor business practice as well as risks around certain business models. Proposals in this consultation seek to improve standards in the sector but in a way that leaves scope for further innovation.
Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA said:
“When we introduced new rules for crowdfunding, we said we’d review the market as it developed. We believe that loan-based crowdfunding can play a valuable role in providing finance to small businesses and individuals but it’s essential that regulation stays up to date as markets develop. The changes we’re proposing are about ensuring sustainable development of the market and appropriate consumer protections.'   
The FCA is asking for responses to this consultation by 27 October 2018 before publishing rules in a Policy Statement later this year.
Notes to Editors
???CP18/20: full consultation paper.
The interim feedback to the Call for Input to the post-implementation review of the FCA’s crowdfunding rules.
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority.
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

Moneyfall (clone),Warnings,26/07/2018,26/07/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/moneyfall-clone,"Almost all firms and individuals carrying out financial services activities in the UK have to be authorised or registered by us. This firm is not authorised or registered by us but has been targeting people in the UK, claiming to be an authorised firm.
This is what we call a 'clone firm'; and fraudsters usually use this tactic when contacting people out of the blue, so you should be especially wary if you have been cold called. They may use the name of the genuine firm, the 'firm reference number' (FRN) we have given the authorised firm or other details.
You can find out more about this scam tactic and how to protect yourself from clone firms.
Clone firm details
Fraudsters are using or giving out the following details as part of their tactics to scam people in the UK:
Moneyfall (clone of FCA authorised firm)

Email: [email protected]
Be aware that the scammers may give out other false details or mix these with some correct details of the registered firm.
FCA authorised firm details
This FCA authorised firm that fraudsters are claiming to work for has no association with the ‘clone firm’. It is authorised to offer, promote or sell services or products in the UK and its correct details are:

News and Publications
Introduction: Jonathan Davidson, Executive Director, Supervision Retail and Authorisations
Firms’ culture and governance is a priority for us. Culture in financial services is widely accepted as the root cause of major conduct failings in the industry in recent history.
On 4 July, we published rules for extending the Senior Managers and Certification Regime to 47,500 firms. These rules will apply from:
10 December 2018 for Insurers
9 December 2019 for FCA solo-regulated firms
These rules represent another step towards the transformation of culture across financial services. Our aim is to encourage cultures where behaviours are driven by what is the right thing to do – not just by what you need to do to be compliant.
To prepare, firms need to:
make sure Senior Managers have clear responsibilities,
check and confirm certified staff are fit and proper annually
ensure financial services staff understand how the Five Conduct Rules apply to them
We’ve published a video overview and user-friendly guides to explain the rules and the principles of the Regime.
We have also published our proposals for introducing a Directory of financial services workers. We’ve listened to feedback that it’s important for firms and consumers to be able to check the status of financial services staff. We want to make it easier for people to be confident they can find the right people to deal with.
These publications help to encourage confidence in the industry. They set clear standards of behaviour and make it easier to verify information about individuals working in financial services.

Hot topics
Retirement Outcomes Review final report
On 28 June, we published the final report of our Retirement Outcomes Review. We found that the freedom and choice introduced by the pensions freedoms have been popular, but have also required people to make more complicated decisions about retirement than previously. Our review focused on consumers who do not take advice and found that some of them are at risk of harm. 
We proposed a range of remedies to address the harms we identified and put the market on a good footing for the future. These are focused on three stages – providing better communications, support and guidance before consumers access their pensions savings; at the point of entering drawdown or buying an annuity; and once a consumer has entered drawdown. These remedies range from improving wake-up packs to requiring that providers offer ready-made drawdown investment solutions. 
We are consulting on some of these remedies now, and will do further work on others before consulting again. We are requesting comments on our proposals for discussion (questions 1-33 and 47-49) by 9 August, and comments on our proposals for consultation (questions 34-46) by 6 September.
FCA and Practitioner Panel survey: 2018 report
We and the Practitioner Panel have published the findings from our 2018 joint survey of FCA-regulated firms. The survey gives views across the financial services sector of our performance as a regulator. It is carried out on our behalf by Kantar Public, an independent market research organisation, who sent the survey to a sample of firms. This gives firms an opportunity to provide their views on how we regulate industry.
The results are the highest positive indicators since the survey began. The scores which we use to track for overall satisfaction and effectiveness have continued to increase. There is an increase in confidence that our oversight of the industry will deliver on all three of our operational objectives:
securing an appropriate degree of protection for consumers
protecting and enhancing the integrity of the UK financial system
promoting effective competition in the interests of consumers
In particular, confidence around our competition objective (promoting effective competition in the interests of consumers) is up significantly from 60% to 72%. 
The analysis of the findings has also identified areas for improvement, which we will continue to address over the coming year:
facilitating innovation within UK financial services
transparency of regulation
more forward-looking regulation
We will use the results to better understand the issues affecting all firms and help improve how we work. The results have been presented to the Practitioner Panel and the FCA Board. You can read the report on our website and also find out more about the Practitioner Panels.
Operational Resilience
Addressing the industry’s operational resilience is a cross–sector priority in the FCA’s 2018/19 Business Plan. The interconnectedness of the industry and increasing reliance on complex technology and shared infrastructure creates risks as well as benefits.  
Operational resilience failures, including those caused by cyber-attacks and technology failures, pose a risk to the supply of business services provided by firms, and can cause harm to consumers and other market participants. Disruptive events will happen so all firms need to plan for these eventualities, be able to absorb the shocks, and maintain or quickly resume the business services they provide to consumers or  other market participants. 
We will strengthen supervisory assessments of the highest impact firms to better understand their current and planned use of technology, resilience to cyber-attacks and staff expertise; review how governance, strategy, systems architecture, risk management and culture contribute to firms’ data security. We will also conduct focused thematic work with ‘lower impact’ firms, based on harms identified in each sector. 
On 5 July we published a Discussion Paper jointly with the PRA and Bank of England. Operational resilience affects all the supervisory authorities’ objectives (safety and soundness of firms, harm to consumers/market participants, and UK financial stability). The Discussion Paper explains why operational resilience is relevant to the supervisory authorities’ objectives, why it should matter to firms and their senior management, and how current supervisory approaches could be developed.  We encourage you to read the Discussion Paper and give your feedback.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017/18
On Thursday 19 July, we published our Annual Report and Accounts 2017/18.  
We also published our Annual Diversity Report, Annual AML report, Annual Competition Report and Annual Enforcement Performance Report.  
Our Annual Report and Accounts looks back on key pieces of work we undertook throughout 2017/18. 
Highlights from this year include:
our work to prepare for EU withdrawal
our continued work to implement EU and domestic legislation affecting financial services including the implementation of MiFID II and PSD2
extending the Senior Managers and Certification Regime to non-executive directors and preparing for the extension to all financial services firms
our work on high cost credit and consumer debt
launching a campaign to alert PPI customers to the deadline for complaints about mis-selling
The FCA’s Annual Public Meeting will be held on 11 September at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London. Register your place via our event website.

Strategic Review of Retail Banking Business Models progress report published
On 27 June we published a progress report on our Strategic Review of Retail Banking Business Models. The report looks at the different sources of competitive advantage that have helped major banks to retain their market shares despite progress made by challenger banks. The review also shows that most Personal Current Accounts customers contribute to their bank’s profits, but a small proportion pay significantly more than others.
We are keen to continue engaging with participants across the industry to discuss our work and are now asking for responses to this update by 7 September 2018.

Cash Savings discussion paper
We have published a Discussion Paper on price discrimination in the cash savings market. We are concerned that the interest rates that longstanding customers receive on easy access cash savings products are generally lower than those on accounts opened more recently. So we are opening a discussion on the harm and options to address the harm, including the introduction of a basic savings rate (BSR) to improve outcomes for longstanding customers.
We welcome feedback by 25 October 2018.
Outsourcing to the cloud
The European Banking Authority (EBA) has issued Recommendations on outsourcing to cloud services providers. We have also updated our own cloud guidance to reflect changes to relevant legislation. Our guidance will be relevant to all firms interested in outsourcing to the cloud, apart from banks, building societies, designated investment firms or IFPRU investment firms who should refer to the EBA’s recommendations in the future.

Life insurance & Pension Providers
Non-advised drawdown project
On 28 March we published the findings of our review into sales of non-advised drawdown pensions. We found that firms did not always adequately inform customers about guarantees such as Guaranteed Annuity Rates or other special features. It is essential that customers have full disclosure of guarantees to be able to make informed choices. To remind firms of their obligations, we recently wrote to those within our life insurer portfolio highlighting the revised Safeguarded Benefits regulations which the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) introduced in April this year. We expect firms to comply with both our rules and the DWP regulations.

EU Withdrawal
FCA’s Role in Preparing for EU Withdrawal
Following the Treasury’s announcement on 27 June about its approach to amending financial services legislation under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act, we have published a statement with an update on how we are preparing for the UK leaving the European Union.
Preparing your firm for EU Withdrawal
As the UK prepares to leave the EU, FCA solo regulated firms should consider if or how they will be affected and what action they may need to take. We recently published further information on the EU withdrawal section of our website on areas for firms to consider. As more information about what Brexit will mean for financial services emerges, firms need to make sure they understand the implications and plan accordingly.
Keynote Speech on EU Withdrawal
On 19 July Nausicaa Delfas, our Executive Director of International, gave a keynote speech on EU Withdrawal at an event hosted by TheCityUK. The speech set out how the FCA is preparing for a smooth transition, what we expect from firms we regulate and our future vision for the UK-EU relationship in financial services.
Temporary Permissions Regime
The Treasury published the statutory instrument on TPR on 24 July. We have provided more details on our website for firms and funds currently passporting into the UK.
Statutory Instruments
The Treasury set out its approach to amending financial services legislation under the EU (Withdrawal) Act on 27 June. It will use statutory instruments (SIs) to do this, and laid the first of these on 16 July. They covered amendments to the Consumer Credit Act and related legislation, amendments to the Friendly Societies Act, a transfer of responsibility to the FCA for EU Binding Technical Standards (BTS), and powers to amend the FCA Handbook for Brexit. HMT has since published SIs amending the Building Societies Act, CCPs and for the temporary permissions regime.  Firms do not need to prepare to implement this legislation now. Please see the Treasury and FCA statements for more information.

Continuing our successful Live & Local events programme that began in April 2016, we have launched our 2018/19 programme. From September 2018, we will be travelling across the UK with a new series of events for regulated firms. 
The first set of events will take place from September to December 2018. This year, we have added events for non-bank payment services firms as well as events for general insurance and mortgage firms. 
Visit our Live & Local webpages for dates, locations and registration links.  
Measuring our impact before we intervene
We have published a suite of documents to provide our stakeholders with a clear picture of how we assess the likely impact of our policies:
‘How we analyse the costs and benefits of our policies’ sets out our approach to cost benefit analysis (CBA)
‘When and how we use field trials’ clarifies when we consider it appropriate to undertake field trials to gather evidence
‘Estimating the benefits of interventions that affect consumer behaviour’ discusses techniques that may be used to estimate the benefits of our policy interventions
We welcome views from stakeholders about the approach and techniques we use.
Recognising industry codes: policy statement and final rules published
We have published our policy statement  and final rules for recognising industry codes of conduct. This sets out our approach to recognising industry-written codes for certain unregulated activities. 
This, in combination with the new Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR) obligations, aims to encourage the take-up of good quality industry codes to raise standards of conduct in financial markets outside our regulation. Firms and individuals subject to the SM&CR that follow a recognised code will tend to meet their obligation to observe ‘proper standards of market conduct’.
Code authors may now submit their codes to us for recognition.
Claims Management consultation open
We are consulting on proposals that outline how we will regulate claims management companies (CMCs) when regulation passes to the FCA on 1 April 2019.
This Consultation Paper (CP) sets out the draft rules and guidance we propose to make for claims management activities and the standards we think CMCs regulated by us should have to meet. We also set out why and how we enforce our rules, and the process for CMCs to become authorised by us.
The deadline for providing feedback on our proposals is 3 August 2018. You can respond by completing the online response form or emailing your responses to [email protected]
Approach to Consumers & Duty of Care
Our Approach to Consumers document, published on 17 July 2018, sets out our vision for well-functioning markets for consumers and the conditions we want to see to achieve this. We explain how we use our powers and tools to protect consumers, and commit to review and adapt these to ensure we achieve the greatest impact for consumers.  
To make our expectations of firms clear and ensure good outcomes for consumers, particularly vulnerable consumers, we plan to consult early next year on guidance for firms on the identification and treatment of vulnerable consumers. As part of developing that guidance we are hosting an event looking at how to make financial services work well for consumers in vulnerable circumstance on 18 September 2018. This event will explore what good looks like for vulnerable consumers and the challenges for consumers and firms, to encourage discussion and innovation around the issues.  For information about the event, please email [email protected] 
Alongside the Approach to Consumers, we published a Discussion Paper on a duty of care and the potential alternative approaches. Feedback to our Future Approach to Consumers consultation paper showed differing views and concerns, so  it is important that we have an open discussion and debate about the potential merits of a duty of care. In this Discussion Paper we also consider and seek views on alternative approach  that might address stakeholders’ concerns. This discussion paper is open for consultation until 2 November 2018.Please send us your views by email at [email protected] 
Christopher Woolard speech on pensions and intergenerational differences
On 16 July, FCA Executive Director of Strategy and Competition, Christopher Woolard, gave a speech to the Pensions Policy Institute, entitled ’Intergenerational challenges: what Mike and the Mechanics can teach us about pensions’. 
The speech discussed how demographic shifts and economic trends over the last 30 or so years have remade the social contract across the generations – from the difficulties younger people face getting on the housing ladder, to the need for older people to pay for care for longer. 
Christopher outlined that the question of how to deal with such challenges is not for the regulator to lead, but rather for democratically elected governments. But we do have a role to play. With a broad, complicated remit and finite resources, we have to target in our interventions to yield the best results. So we focus on areas where we can have the biggest impact. 
In particular, the aim which unifies our pensions work, whether it’s the Asset Management Market Study, Retirement Outcomes Review or Investment Platforms Market Study, is to ensure consumers have the best outcomes possible in retirement.
Firms’ use of their authorisation/ regulatory status in a promotional way 
Our Financial Promotions team has intelligence that some firms are using their FCA-authorised status in a promotional way. This which could lead to consumer harm and is against our rules. Firms must not use their authorisation status in that way and, if they are, should cease doing so. 
We have recently conducted a review looking at how firms present their FCA authorisation status on their websites. We remind firms of their obligations 1) when communicating with clients, including details about the extent of their FCA authorisation/regulation, and 2) in relation to the use of the FCA logo. For example:
Unclear, unfair and misleading statements by a firm may involve a breach of FCA’s Principles for Businesses, Principle 7.
GEN 1.2.2AR (Referring to approval by the FCA), the purpose of which is to prevent clients being misled about the extent to which the FCA has approved a firm’s affairs, and
GEN 4.5 (Statements about authorisation and regulation by the appropriate regulator), in particular, GEN 4 Annex 1R sets out the required disclosure statements for FCA authorised persons, with relevant notes. Note 5 (GEN 4 Annex 1R) relates to the presentation of those statements, which includes, for example, the use of images, symbols (such as shields, ticks, padlocks) and wording in addition to the relevant required disclosure statement. Firms are reminded to present and communicate information in a way which is clear, fair and not misleading.
We have previously issued a statement on our website confirming that firms are not allowed to use our logo without our permission. 
Firms must not indicate or imply that they are regulated or otherwise supervised by the FCA in respect of business for which they are not regulated by the FCA (GEN 4.5.4R). 
So we strongly encourage firms to review their websites and financial promotions. Where adverts refer to the FCA and use images or symbols, firms must ensure that these adverts comply with our requirements. Where we identify firms who are in breach of our rules, we will take action.
New prescribed responsibility for deposit takers and dual-regulated investment firms
Our new rules for the Senior Managers and Certification Regime include some changes for banks, building societies, credit unions and dual-regulated investment firms.
These changes include a new prescribed responsibility for making sure staff are trained in the Conduct Rules and that we are notified of any breaches. Firms affected will need to submit a Form J to tell us to whom they have allocated this responsibility by 1 November 2018. The updated form will be available from 10 September.
There are some other changes that firms should be aware of. Please read the Policy Statement for more details.

FCA publishes outcome of testing behavioural remedies to address under repayment of credit card debt,Data and research News stories,26/07/2018,26/07/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/fca-publishes-outcome-testing-behavioural-remedies-address-under-repayment-credit-card-debt,"Together with the measures we introduced on persistent credit card debt and earlier intervention (which take effect on 1 September 2018), this is part of our efforts to limit the use of credit cards for longer-term borrowing, while preserving their flexibility for millions of users.
The research builds on academic studies which have shown consumers’ choice of repayment amount can be disproportionately influenced by the contractual minimum repayment (an effect known as anchoring). This results in some consumers being more likely to make minimum repayments or repayments close to the minimum. This means they can end up paying more in debt service costs and taking longer to repay their credit card debt than they need to. While their debt may not yet be problematic, it is more expensive than it needs to be and there is some risk that it may become problematic in the future, for example, in the event of an income shock.
We announced our intention to undertake this research in the credit card market study (CCMS) final report and we described our testing approach in Annex 4 of that report and in CP17/10.
Key findings       
Manual credit card repayments: Analysis of the credit card market study dataset has shown the majority of credit card repayments are made manually and not by direct debit. We undertook two online hypothetical experiments and found removing the minimum repayment amount from the manual repayment screen (de-anchoring) had a dramatic positive effect, significantly increasing the value of repayments made.
	????
Repayments by direct debit: We used a field trial to test removing the option to pay the minimum repayment amount from the direct debit set up screen. Whilst this measure caused many more people to choose higher direct debit amounts, as intended, surprisingly it didn’t increase overall payment amounts. This was due to two counteracting effects we observed - consumers offset their higher direct debit payments with lower subsequent manual payments and some consumers did not set up a direct debit at all.
	 
Disclosure remedies: Using field trials, we tested providing personalised information to customers with graphics showing the time and cost to repay under different scenarios. We found that providing this information on monthly statements had no effect at all on manual repayments. Targeting this information - to consumers with a direct debit set up to only repay the minimum - caused a small increase in repayment amounts but not a consistent reduction in debt.
Next steps
Given the effects we observed during our testing, we are considering consulting on changing our rules and guidance to mandate the removal of the minimum repayment anchor. We consider a de-anchoring measure has the potential to increase consumers’ credit card repayments where they can afford to do so whilst preserving the flexibility of credit cards, which millions of consumers value.
This is, however, an important and complex area and we are committed to working with stakeholders to achieve appropriate outcomes. Therefore, we plan to engage with interested stakeholders in the coming months about our research findings, the practicalities of implementing such an intervention and, importantly, whether there are likely to be counteracting effects or unintended consequences of a de-anchoring measure on consumers and/or firms. The results from this stakeholder engagement will inform our thinking in this area.
We do not propose to mandate an increase to the level of minimum repayments (required under CONC 6.7.5R) at this time. Firms are in the process of implementing our persistent debt and earlier intervention measures and some are responding by raising minimum repayment levels. We are keen to preserve flexibility for those who cannot afford higher repayments. We will reassess this issue once we have had time to assess the impact of the CCMS package of remedies and the industry and consumer responses to these.

FCA opens a discussion on introducing a basic savings rate in the cash savings market,Press Releases,25/07/2018,25/07/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-opens-discussion-introducing-basic-savings-rate-cash-savings-market,"The FCA has set out a range of options to address issues faced by longstanding customers including introducing a basic savings rate (BSR).
The FCA is concerned that the interest rates that longstanding customers receive on easy access cash savings products are generally lower than those received by customers who shop around.
The Discussion Paper seeks input on how to address the harm caused by this price discrimination. The BSR option would apply to all easy access cash saving accounts and easy access cash ISAs after they have been open for a set period of time, such as a year.
Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA said:
'Providers can take advantage of high levels of customer inaction to pay lower interest rates to longstanding customers. While many customers have valid reasons for not shopping around, providers must still treat them fairly, while maintaining competitive rates for those who do.
'Efforts to encourage customers to switch have had limited impact and we remain concerned about the way firms are treating customers. This is why we are considering the introduction of a basic savings rate for older accounts, which would promote competition and help get customers a better rate of interest.'
87% of UK adults have cash savings. In 2015, the FCA completed a competition study into the cash savings market. This found that competition was not working well, particularly for customers who stay with the same provider for a long time.
It also found that customers are put off switching by the expected difficulty; large, well-established personal current account providers are able to attract most savings balances despite offering lower rates; and there is a lack of product transparency.
The FCA implemented a package of measures to address some of this harm, which came into force in 2016. This included trialling other disclosure remedies proposed in the Market Study, including a switching box, but they did not stimulate sufficient changes in customer behaviour to address the harm to longstanding customers.  
The FCA is now seeking feedback on the options set out in this Discussion Paper, which closes on the 25 October 2018.

Four former directors of online consumer credit broker banned for misleading customers,Press Releases,25/07/2018,25/07/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/four-former-directors-online-consumer-credit-broker-banned-misleading-customers,"The firm took fees of over £7.2 million from approximately 124,000 online customers by duping them into believing they had been approved for short term loans.
Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, said:
“These four individuals consistently misled vulnerable customers into paying money for worthless services and into believing SMM had found them a loan, in addition to selling on their data. They showed complete disregard for the consequences of their actions. We have taken the strongest action possible to prevent them from working in financial services again.'
The FCA found that between November 2013 and July 2014 all four lacked honesty and integrity as they had deliberately misled often vulnerable customers, in relation to fees and services provided through web-based brands i-loansdirect, LoanZoo and the1loan.
Customers searching for loans online were informed on arrival at the websites they had been ‘approved’. They were shown details of a sample loan and were asked to enter their payment card details in order to ‘verify their account’. Customers were not pre-approved for a loan and there was no such account verification, instead their cards were charged between £39 and £69. Many of Secure My Money’s (SMM’s) customers, including those least able to afford the fees, were unaware a fee would be charged.
The sites’ membership areas then purported to provide a list of pre-approved loan offers. In reality, Secure My Money had no contact or arrangements with any lenders. Customers had been presented with a standard, untailored list of web links primarily to lender website homepages.
The FCA took over regulation of consumer credit firms in April 2014. In May 2014, the FCA asked SMM to take down the websites. SMM disabled the homepages, informing the FCA that it had taken them down for new customers. All four individuals knew however that the majority of customers arrived on the sites via other pages, that those pages were still live and that SMM was still taking fees from new customers.
From late May 2014, SMM started charging customers a further monthly fee of £4.99 for continued access to membership areas. To increase revenue, Mr Kennedy subsequently arranged for the £4.99 charge to be backdated to March 2014, even though he was aware that doing so was outside customer terms and conditions. Mr Mullins had also arranged for customers clicking on lender icons in the membership areas instead to be redirected to other fee-charging credit broker websites. The sale of customers’ personal data to third parties led to some customers receiving multiple marketing calls or texts, and in some instances to customers being charged by more than one credit broker.
The bans imposed by the FCA are the strongest sanction available in this case as the conduct took place before the FCA had the power to fine individuals at consumer credit firms. The Insolvency Service, with assistance from the FCA, disqualified all four individuals as directors last year for periods of between 5-8 years. The FCA’s bans remain in place for life or for as long as necessary for consumer protection.
SMM went into liquidation on 31 July 2014. Approximately £1.4 million was repaid by SMM as a result of customers either requesting chargebacks from card providers or making refund requests direct to the firm, and a further £33,564.17 was paid out after SMM’s liquidation.
Notes to Editors
Final notices for Mark Robert Kennedy, David James Carter Mullins, Edward John Booth and Christopher Paul Brotherton.
The FCA’s bans are for unlimited duration subject to individual rights to apply for bans to be lifted at a later date.
On 1 April 2014, consumer credit regulation transferred from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to the Financial Conduct Authority. On that date, we became responsible for approximately 50,000 consumer credit firms, including credit brokers.
The FCA introduced new rules on 2 January 2015 restricting the way credit brokers can charge fees, and have made a lot of changes over the last 4 years of consumer credit regulation to help protect people.
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

The Financial Services (Banking Reform Act) 2013 requires the Authorities to review this MoU annually. The Authorities committed that this review would include feedback from regulated entities, and that a summary of the review’s findings would be published. 2018 saw the third such review.
The BoE’s Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, the FCA Board, the PRA’s Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation and the PSR Board have reviewed how the MoU is working. They have considered the views of industry and staff, concluding that cooperation and coordination under the MoU is working well. Building on the initiatives identified in the 2017 review and implemented over the last year, the Authorities have identified a number of areas to further deepen cooperation and coordination; these will be implemented over the coming year. In conducting this review, the Authorities emphasised their on-going commitment to working closely together on issues of common regulatory interest and avoiding duplication. The Authorities are also making minor changes to the MoU this year to reflect recent legislative changes or other structural changes, or in relation to those changes. The Authorities will also review the MoU over the next year to ensure it continues to appropriately reflect their respective roles and responsibilities once the United Kingdom has left the EU.

“While this Annual Report illustrates the wide range of our activities, there are three key areas that particularly define our work this year.
“The first is our work to prepare for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
“The second is regulatory change: this year we have applied legislation which will have profound implications for firms’ transparency, the way they treat consumers and in some cases even their business models. This has included MiFIDII, the second Payment Services Directive and preparing for the extension of the Senior Managers and Certification Regime to all firms.
“And the third area is ensuring that firms treat consumers fairly. Our work this year has sent a clear message to firms that, if they do not treat customers fairly, then we will take action.'

Introduction
It has been a remarkable year in international affairs – dominated by change. So, I would like to take a step back today and offer a few reflections on an area which I know matters to many of you, and where we aim to give you some consistency: the FCA’s preparations for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
Since my appointment earlier this year, I have been meeting many of you, regulated firms in the UK, and your advisers, business groups and corporate treasurers, as well as my regulatory counterparts in Europe, US and Asia, and consumer representatives. I have valued hearing directly from you about the impacts and issues for you, in the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, and using these insights to shape FCA’s approach and preparations. I have also been building up the International Division at the FCA, to ensure we can drive forward the policy and delivery work that is required.  And as a member of the FCA’s Executive Committee, I have been working with my colleagues to balance this work against the FCA’s other priorities, of regulating 58,000 firms. It is certainly a most interesting time to be in this role.
So today I will set out:
how we at the FCA are preparing, behind the scenes, for a smooth transition
what we expect from firms we regulate, and
our future vision
We will support the Government throughout the Brexit process with technical advice and our specialist expertise.
I should preface my comments by reiterating that the FCA takes no position on whether Brexit is a good or bad thing in itself. Our focus, as always, is on making financial markets work well, and meeting the FCA’s three statutory objectives, to:
Secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers.
Protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system.
Promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.
And to deliver on these objectives we will support the Government throughout the Brexit process with technical advice and our specialist expertise.
In summary:
With 8 months until we exit the European Union in March 2019, it is important we all – regulators and industry – continue to plan for a range of scenarios.
The FCA is working closely with the Government, Bank of England, our regulatory partners across the world, and firms, to enable a smooth transition at exit.
In terms of our longer-term future – our markets will remain highly integrated whatever the outcome of Brexit. We believe a good outcome is achievable – one that is in the interests of both the UK and the EU.
Preparing for a smooth transition
Across the FCA, together with colleagues from the Bank of England and the Government, we have been working to develop a number of safeguards and contingencies.
Our starting assumption is that a transition or implementation period, from March 2019 until the end of December 2020, will form part of the final agreement with the EU. We think this is a good thing for both sides. It will allow more time to prepare, smooth the transition, and it is something we have been calling for, for some time.
However, we know that this is part of the overall negotiations and therefore we must prepare for all scenarios, including the possibility of a ‘no-deal’ or ‘hard’ Brexit at March 2019. And that is what we are doing: across the FCA, together with colleagues from the Bank of England and the Government, we have been working to develop a number of safeguards and contingencies, in the event of a hard Brexit, to ensure that ‘day 1’ works smoothly.
Let us just consider some examples of the challenges we face in doing this – there are ‘cliff edge’ risks that would be caused by abrupt loss of passporting. Some are within our gift to resolve, others are not, and require agreement with the EU.
‘Cliff edge’ risks
There are ‘cliff edge’ risks we face in relation to contract continuity.
Our analysis suggests that these primarily relate to insurance contracts and derivatives. The FPC has estimated that 10 million UK policyholders and 38 million EEA policyholders could be affected; and that around a quarter of derivatives contracts – £26 trillion worth – could be affected.
However, the types of contracts affected may be broader than this. You in this room will know well how complex these contracts are, involving not only financing and credit agreements, but also hedges against interest rates and currency movements.  Our view is that where any of these contracts extend beyond March 2019, the UK and the EU must, together, create contractual certainty, either through an implementation period or by some other means.
If this is not achieved, there is a risk that some of these contracts could not be appropriately serviced – in concrete terms, insurers may not be permitted to pay out claims on policies, and derivatives users may not be able to manage the risks of their positions. This would not enhance the integrity of markets, nor serve the interests of consumers, either in the UK or in the EU.
This is an example of a situation where both sides could take unilateral approaches to dealing with the risk (and I will talk later about what in the UK the Government has proposed to do with regard to that), but where a bilateral solution with the EU would be preferable. We remain closely engaged with our EU27 regulators and ESMA, both on the day to day business of being an EU member, but also on issues related to EU withdrawal. For example, we are participating in a technical group set up by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank which is taking account of potential Brexit risks, including contract continuity, and which we strongly welcome.
Legal and Regulatory Framework
In other areas, we and the Government are taking action to smooth the transition in the UK, unilaterally, regardless of the outcome of the negotiations.
For example, to ensure continuity of the legal and regulatory framework post withdrawal, when EU law ceases to have effect in the UK, we have undertaken significant work around the EU Withdrawal Act. Now this Bill has received Royal Assent, existing EU legislation will be converted into UK law after March 2019, and UK laws which implement EU obligations will be preserved. The aim is that, as far as possible, to ensure continuity and certainty, the same rules and laws will apply after exit day as they did the day before.
In addition, the Withdrawal Act also gives Ministers the power to amend retained legislation via Statutory Instrument (SI), ensuring it functions effectively post-Brexit.  HMT laid three SIs earlier this week.
Accordingly, we at the FCA have been working over the past months on identifying the various aspects that may need amending, and how these might be resolved. The most obvious examples are references to the Commission, or European Supervisory Authorities, which will have no jurisdiction here after Brexit; others include functions currently performed by EU bodies which will no longer be appropriate when UK leaves the EU (eg supervision of credit ratings agencies and trade repositories); or the broader impact of loss of passporting (which led to our preparatory work on the Temporary Permissions Regime, which I will cover in more detail shortly).
The changes in the legislation through Statutory Instruments will also mean changes to our rule book. We have been undertaking a line by line review of around 50 pieces of EU financial services legislation, and 185 Binding Technical Standards (the technical detail below the EU Directives and Regulations).
We aim to consult on these changes in the autumn. This will ensure our Handbook and associated rules are fully operational at the point of exit.
In the run up to March 2019, we will limit any other Handbook changes to those that are in line with our Business Plan, or otherwise essential.
Temporary Permissions Regime
A further key safeguard we have been working on is the Temporary Permissions Regime (TPR), which will allow EEA firms and funds using a UK passport to continue to operate, without needing to apply for authorisation at this stage. At the end of last year, HMT announced that they would legislate to enable this if necessary.
The TPR will allow for business as usual for EEA firms and funds passporting into the UK. As at April this year, more than 8,500 financial services firms were registered as passporting into the UK, and nearly 6,000 out of the UK. Those that receive a temporary permission will be able to enter into new business and fulfil existing contracts with UK customers for a defined period after exit day, while seeking full authorisation. We will be issuing more communications on what firms will need to do in order to register for temporary permission, and we will be consulting on the related rules. So far, we have issued a short survey on our website which allows firms to indicate their intention to do so. I would like to thank our colleagues in National Competent Authorities across Europe for helping us to draw this to the attention of firms based in their jurisdictions that passport in to the UK.
Once they have temporary permission, firms will be given a period of time, or ‘landing slot’, within which they’ll need to submit their authorisation application. We will confirm landing slots to firms in due course so they can prepare their applications. We expect the first of these slots to be later in 2019, with the last timed towards the end of the temporary permissions period.
The intention here is to support a smooth transition – and this will certainly help for ‘incoming’ business.   That is the part that is in our gift.
However, we are aware that this work does not necessarily resolve the challenge for all firms, particularly those that need to continue to access the EU – ‘outgoing business’ – as currently there is no reciprocal ‘TPR’ arrangement from the EU. And the challenges this presents, in terms of lack of commercial certainty, and business disruption, is clear from my speaking to senior leaders in regulated firms.
Needless to say, we think this is necessary to provide certainty and smooth the transition, and it is something we stand ready to discuss with our EU counterparts.
Throughout this work, with consumer protection at the front of our minds, we have engaged with the FCA Consumer Panel and other bodies to ascertain their concerns and respond to them accordingly. As part of the onshored legislation, we are seeking to maximise continuity for consumers to the extent possible. The temporary permissions regime will work to remove any interruption of service to consumers of EEA firms.
And this leads me on to our expectations of regulated firms in their preparation for March 2019 and beyond.
The FCA’s expectations of firms
Whilst it is for individual firms to take responsibility for their own plans to ensure a successful transition, our role is to ensure relevant markets work well. We intend to continue to work closely with you on this, including providing guidance to you where we can. As I have said earlier, our focus is to ensure that our objectives are met throughout withdrawal – that we protect consumers, maintain the integrity of the UK financial system,  and promote competition in the interests of consumers. Firms need to maintain threshold conditions and our rules throughout – I thought it would be helpful to set out some of the areas we have been discussing with firms so far:
If you are expanding your presence in Europe, the structures you put in place must enable us to supervise your UK business effectively, and ensure that you continue to meet our threshold conditions.
Just as you are making preparations, have you checked that your supply chains are similarly prepared?
If you are relocating senior management, are you ensuring that appropriate senior oversight remains in the UK?
We expect you to continue to service your customers as fully and fairly as the law permits, and to communicate with affected customers, in the UK and elsewhere, in a clear and timely fashion, including, for example, what regulatory protections will apply for your customers.
We regulate 58,000 firms. My observation from my engagement with firms, our Panels, and industry groups is that overall, many firms are advanced in their contingency planning.
This morning, we published a webpage Preparing your firm for Brexit, aimed at helping firms to understand whether they will be affected by EU withdrawal, and if so, to:
Work out what changes you might have to make to your business, or which additional regulatory permissions you may need to continue to carry it out.
Think about any information you will need to give to customers, in a way that is clear, fair and not misleading.
Consider the implications of a range of possible scenarios including an implementation period.
Discuss implications with the relevant EEA regulator, your trade association, and/or get independent legal advice.
I have spoken so far about how we get to ‘day 1’ – the exit from the EU. I would now like to turn to our future vision for the longer term.
Future vision
We face challenges in the short term – but the fundamentals are strong for us to continue to have a close relationship with our EU counterparts over the long run.
We face challenges in the short term – but the fundamentals are strong for us to continue to have a close relationship with our EU counterparts over the long run.
At day one, our regimes will be equivalent. Our markets will remain highly integrated whatever the outcome of Brexit, and we think working to promote common global standards, alongside our work to onshore a rulebook that is equivalent to the EU on day one, provides a solid basis for cross border business to take place.
It is of course for the Government to negotiate – but we have been clear about the sort of arrangements on financial services that we believe are possible, and desirable, to maximise market access and benefits to consumers in the UK and EU. These include the five principles of:
cross border market access
consistent global standards to support global markets
co-operation between regulatory authorities
influence over standards
the opportunity to recruit and maintain a skilled workforce
Neither the UK nor the EU want to see a significant misalignment in regulatory standards – nor indeed ‘a race to the bottom’ in regulatory standards.  But it is likely that after our exit from the EU, our regulatory frameworks may evolve.  So we need to find a way to ensure that despite such evolution, frameworks allow delivery of common outcomes.
Common outcomes should be the criteria by which we judge one another’s regulatory position, and thus the access that we are prepared to grant to one another’s markets. What matters more is not what road we take, but what that final destination is – and as long as the UK and the EU maintain a commitment to protecting consumers and to strong, open markets, there is no reason this cannot work in practice.
This is a clearly achievable aim. Not least because it is overwhelmingly in the interests of both the UK and EU: it is in the interests of UK and EU consumers; it is in the interests of UK and EU firms; it is in the interests of UK and EU markets. We hope that we can see progress on this in the very near future.
The Government last week published its White Paper on the future relationship with the EU, laying out the main elements of the UK position. The financial services chapter proposes: that the UK and the EU provide access to each other’s markets on the basis of equivalence of rules on an outcomes basis, across a broad scope of activities, and on the basis of predictable processes and governance arrangements.
At the supervisory level, we have deep relationships with our European counterparts, including information sharing – for example, in an average month we route around 250 million transaction reports to other National Competent Authorities in the EU. We cooperate on common challenges through ESMA and the other European Supervisory Authorities and we work closely on policy issues - hence the common rulebooks we have today. Whilst we will no longer be a member of the EU, we are committed to keeping our relationships as close as possible.
Global influence
Part of the new relationship will depend on how the FCA interacts with the rest of the world. Now, in our preparations, we have started discussions with regulators around the world on our Memorandums of Understanding, agreements that underpin third country equivalence, access and information sharing.
More broadly, we have always played an active role in developing the global standards that we have today. And we are continuing to play that role progressing international regulatory reform at the global level. For example, we have recently proposed a FinTech Network within IOSCO, which we will be chairing; we co-chair the market conduct group on IAIS, and the asset management group in IOSCO.
We have remained closely involved with the work at the Financial Stability Board on asset management and on benchmarks.
Regardless of the future relationship between the UK and the EU, we will still face global challenges that must have global solutions. And accordingly, we remain committed to focusing on working with global partners to find those global solutions.
And we are working to improve cyber resilience in the face of new threats: I continue to represent the FCA on the G7 cyber expert group, at IOSCO and FSB, and co-chair the CPMI-IOSCO cyber group on that advancing resilience in financial market infrastructures across the world.
Regardless of the future relationship between the UK and the EU, we will still face global challenges that must have global solutions. And accordingly, we remain committed to focusing on working with global partners to find those global solutions.
Conclusion
Yes, the scale of the Brexit challenge is unprecedented, but we believe a good outcome is achievable. And from a regulatory perspective, we are working with the Government, the Bank of England and our counterparts across the world to secure just that.
But we all know that time is tight and the path uncertain – so achieving that outcome, and a smooth transition avoiding cliff edges – requires energy and commitment from industry and regulators alike.
I look forward to continuing to work with you as we move forward.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

As part of our asset management market study, we referred this sector to the CMA for a detailed investigation because we had serious competition concerns.

These services matter because the firms involved provide advice and services to the pension schemes which so many consumers rely on. According to the CMA, investment consultants advise on, and fiduciary managers take decisions for, the investment of at least £1.6 trillion of pension scheme assets which affect millions of pension scheme members and their families.
We agree with the CMA that it is important that the remedies address the potential harm in this sector effectively. We look forward to reviewing the CMA’s detailed findings and suggested remedies, including their recommendation to extend the FCA’s regulatory perimeter, and will continue to work closely with the CMA in the coming months as the remedies are finalised.

"The Financial Conduct Authority publishes Approach to Consumers paper, alongside Discussion Paper on Duty of Care",Press Releases,17/07/2018,20/07/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/approach-consumers-paper-discussion-paper-duty-care,"The discussion paper explores if there is a need for a specific duty of care requirement for firms in financial services.  It explores if a new duty of care could enhance good conduct and culture and provide additional protections for consumers.
If changes are required the paper asks what those changes could look like and what the impact would be for consumers, firms and the FCA.  It also explores what the possible alternative approaches to a new duty might be.
The Approach to Consumers sets out the FCA’s expectations, first published for consultation in 6 November 2017, on how consumers should be treated by financial firms and where the FCA will intervene if things are going wrong.  It gives a further insight into the wide range of powers the FCA has at its disposal to ensure consumers are protected, particularly some of the most vulnerable people in society. 
The paper sets out the FCA vision of what a well-functioning market looks like, when and how the FCA will act to protect consumers, and its policy positions on key issues.
Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive at the FCA, said:
'Consumer protection is absolutely central to the FCA’s purpose and Mission. Nearly everyone at some stage in their life will come into contact with a financial organisation and people need to know that they are being treated fairly and that the right protections are in place. Different groups of consumers have different financial needs, which will naturally change over their lifetime.'
'As we have demonstrated in the past we will act to address harm or potential harm using the range of powers and tools at our disposal to protect consumers. To ensure we provide the necessary protections and deliver good outcomes for consumers we need to regularly review our approach, so we can reflect the diverse population of the UK and consumers’ changing needs in a rapidly-evolving and increasingly complex environment.  The papers published today are part of this continuing work.'
When the FCA launched its Mission, it committed to publishing a series of documents that would explain its approach to regulation in more depth. These articulate how the FCA carries out its main activities, aiming to provide transparency to its thought process and decision-making.
The Financial Conduct Authority is asking stakeholders for comments on the Duty of Care paper by 2 November 2018.  We will also consult early next year on guidance for firms to help them understand more clearly our expectations and requirements for dealing with vulnerable people.

Intergenerational challenges: what Mike and the Mechanics can teach us about pensions,Speeches,16/07/2018,27/07/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/intergenerational-challenges-pensions,"Speaker: Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy and CompetitionLocation: Pensions Policy Institute, LondonDelivered on: 16 July 2018
Highlights:
Demographic shifts and economic trends over the last 30 or so years have remade the social contract across the generations – from the difficulties younger people face getting on the housing ladder, to the need for older people to pay for care for longer.
The question of how to deal with such challenges is not for the regulator to lead, but rather for democratically elected governments. But we do have a role to play.
With a broad, complicated remit and finite resources, we have to be targeted in our interventions to yield the best results. So we focus on areas where we can have the biggest impact.
The aim that unifies our pensions work, whether it’s the Asset Management Market Study, Retirement Outcomes Review or Platforms Market Study, is to ensure consumers have the best outcomes possible in retirement.
Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version.
I’d like to start with a song. Not, you’ll be pleased to hear, one I’m going to sing myself. But, rather, a lyric.
“Every generation blames the one before. And all of their frustrations, come beating on your door.'
I’m pretty sure Mike and the Mechanics aren’t often called upon to help explain pensions policy. But I quote the 80s supergroup because they happen to have landed on a defining issue of our time, perhaps the defining issue.
When Paul Carrack sings those lines, he could be referring to the way young people feel about getting on the housing ladder, or how people in their 50s feel about their prospects of a comfortable retirement, or even the way people in their 80s worry about ill health or leaving a legacy for their children.
Because demographic shifts and economic trends over the last thirty or so years have fundamentally reconstructed expectations about our circumstances at the beginning, middle and end of our lives.
Today I want to talk about those intergenerational issues that touch on the boundary of our remit as the FCA. And how we, as a regulator whose powers and objectives are granted to us by Parliament, go about fulfilling our duty within this wider context.
The challenges we see today
The way life looks in your 20s and 30s has changed dramatically.
It’s the primordial right of older generations to tell the ones that come after them, “it wasn’t like that in my day'.
But, grating though it may be to the young people on the receiving end, in 2018 it’s a difficult assertion to dispute. Because the way life looks in your 20s and 30s has changed dramatically.
According to the Office for National Statistics, house prices have increased 7% per year since 1980 and the percentage of 25 to 34 years olds who own their own home has withered from 67% in 1991 to 36% in 2014. Accordingly, the Resolution Foundation estimates that while it would have taken a typical household in their late 20s about 3 years to save for an average-sized deposit in the 1980s, it would now take 19.
At the same time, ‘the bank of mum and dad’ is increasingly the lender of choice, or rather necessity, for young people. Government research published last year showed that over a third of first-time buyers in England now turn to family for help, compared to 1 in 5 in 2010.
And, of course, that support is only available to those who have mums and dads with the necessary reserves. With homeownership seemingly out of reach for many, we might expect to see profligacy on the part of young people, splurges on single-origin coffee and avocado toast perhaps.
But rather than a ‘last days of Rome’ nihilism, the evidence suggests many millennials are preoccupied with growing their savings. According to research by the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, half of millennials are saving into a workplace or private pension, a number we’d expect to rise as auto-enrolment grows, and half of them are also putting additional money aside. At the same time there is a nuanced picture here, with higher levels of debt than previous generations, much of it accounted for by student loans.
As a regulator, we can do two things for this younger cohort. We can make sure that when they save that money does the most it can for them, which I’ll talk about later. And for those that do use credit, we can tackle the worst harms we see in the market as we are doing with credit cards and high cost credit.
What about Generation X? By some measures their outlook is pretty rosy. According to our Financial Lives survey, 45 to 54 year olds have some of the highest levels of product ownership, of knowledge about financial matters and of satisfaction with their financial circumstances. Eyeing retirement, 79% have a private pension while 75% hold some form of cash savings product.
So far so good. But this age group is not without its challenges either. 20% of 45 to 54 year olds have no form of private pension arrangement.
Meanwhile, generous DB pension schemes are disappearing. From a high of 8 million enrolled in 1967, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates active membership of private sector DB pensions has fallen to 1.3 million in 2016.
For almost half of all those who reach retirement age, their principal source of income will be their state pension even if they have some private savings. Moreover, debt is a looming presence in the lives of many, with 1.5 million over-indebted 45 to 54 year olds in the UK.
In fact, the Centre for Economics and Business Research estimates that, on average, households aren’t totally debt free until age 69, 12 years later than they expect.
And this trend of taking debt into later life looks set to continue. Research by the Building Societies Association suggests it is becoming increasingly common for consumers to buy for the first time in their late 30s or 40s.
The result is that borrowing into older age will move from niche to mainstream within the next decade, with an estimated 1.42 million 35 to 64 years olds not paying off their mortgage before entering retirement given the current term of their loan.
Again as, policy makers we can respond to this. Earlier this year we concluded our work on the ageing population. We recently amended regulation around retirement interest only mortgages. Meaning we now treat them as standard mortgages, not as equity release.
Shifts in spending into retirement
The main upshot of all these shifting facts and figures is a cultural change in how we view life in our old age.
On the one hand, many people in their 70s are likely to be sitting on significant amounts of accumulated wealth. FCA analysis of ONS data shows 50% of 70 year olds have wealth of approximately £220,000, while 25% have wealth of around £450,000. According to our Financial Lives survey, 71% of people aged 65 and over own their own home outright.
So you might think that this cohort are sitting pretty. But there is still cause to pause.
The reality is that significant numbers of these people are cash poor, with the bulk of their wealth tied up in their home but far less to spend day-to-day.
Our analysis shows that the median net income for individuals aged 70 to 89 is about £13,000 a year, with around a quarter of these people, 1.8 million or so, receiving a net income below £8,300, the new state pension level.
That’s a situation that can quickly turn precarious. Should they fall ill, consumers in this group may find themselves burning through cash to pay for long-term health care, particularly if you live in certain parts of the UK. BBC analysis of NHS data shows residential care could cost £22,000 for those living in south London. And if you have assets and income of over £23,000, you have to pay all of that yourself. Those with assets of less that £14,250 can apply for help from their local authority, though are likely to still have to make contributions from their income.
The issue of care is set to become increasingly acute as many more older people live for longer, often with one or more chronic long-term health conditions. The House of Lords’ report on ageing projected a 90% increase in the number of people in need of care from 2010 to 2030, with an 80% increase in the number of people with dementia alone.
And while headlines are often devoted to some groups not saving enough for retirement, a surprising frugality is permeating some quarters. A recent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) report shows that some retirees hold “unrealistic expectations about [their] chances of survival', which is leading to an “over-reluctance to spend'.
In other words, far from blowing their pension savings on Lamborghinis and lavish holidays, we’re seeing people penny-pinching because they’re trying to make their pot last for longer than is probably necessary.
The same trend can also be seen in Australia, where economists have noted that most retirees in their 60s and 70s draw at modest rates, close to the minimum amounts each year, meaning many are likely to die with substantial amounts unspent. Indeed, the Government has tried to encourage pensioners to spend more.
While life expectancy today is perhaps not as protracted as some retirees seem to assume, it has been on the rise, although that rate of increase has slowed in recent years.
This, predictably, has a knock-on effect.
The estimated average age at which millennials will inherit is 61. That means that where before young people may have expected to receive an inheritance during the expensive, child-rearing stage of their lives, they’re now more likely to be looking towards retirement by the time they receive that financial boost.
It can’t be a bad thing that our parents and grandparents are likely to be with us for longer. But the ramifications of that shift are challenging traditional policymaking parameters, causing some to ask if they should be redrawn entirely.
In short, the race has changed.
The passing of the baton from one generation to the next is being put on hold as older family members comfortably reach 80 and beyond.
The passing of the baton from one generation to the next is being put on hold as older family members comfortably reach 80 and beyond.
The markers that define key stages of our lives, from owning a house to clearing our debts, are in transition.
And, whether you’re just out the blocks or approaching the finish line, life looks different in 2018 than in did for your contemporaries 30 or so years ago, with new and emerging challenges every step of the way.
Which begs the question, if people in their 50s aren’t in their financial sweet spot, nor are people in their 80s and people in their 20s certainly aren’t, who is?
Intergenerational issues and the FCA’s role 
There’s no clear answer to this. Certainly, people in their 40s fare better on average than all other age groups on the measure of net income, which is roughly £18,500 for those in their 40s vs £12,000 for people in their 20s, according to FCA analysis. On total wealth, however, including housing wealth, they are outpaced by people in their 60s, who have on average £290,000 to their £110,000 and hold the most total wealth of all age groups.
But behind the headline data lie huge variations. For example, despite the generous average figure, 10% of 60 years olds hold no wealth at all.
If we’re looking for a ‘golden generation’, it would probably be the 3 million people aged 65 to 75 who both own their home outright and have an occupational DB pension. These have median wealth of £460,000. And 15% of them are significantly wealthier, with wealth over £1m. 
There are no easy solutions for these issues. What is clear, however, is that the remaking of the social contract across the generations presents a huge social challenge.
The conversation around how to manage this is not for us, as the regulator, to lead. That is for democratically elected government, with its powers over taxation, wealth distribution, housing and social policy.
It would be impossible to do our job effectively without considering the wider social context in which we work.
We do have a part to play in the discussion, though. It would be impossible to do our job effectively without considering the wider social context in which we work. Frankly, it would be reckless of us to do so.
And that means we have to apply imagination to the way we regulate.  
Part of this is avoiding resorting to blunt instruments where a more flexible approach would yield more constructive results. When you only have a hammer to hand, every problem looks like a nail. That’s why we draw on a varied toolkit.
But what does this look like in practice when it comes to pensions and retirement outcomes?
Tackling the problems of tomorrow, today
Let’s strip this back to the role we play. The FCA’s core job is to make markets work well and protect consumers. So where we see harm, or the risk of harm, occurring, we have a duty to intervene.
But with a broad, complicated remit and finite resources, we have to be targeted with our interventions to yield the best results.
This comes down to a clear understanding of our role as it relates to the wider landscape I described earlier, and a clear sense of where we can have the biggest impact.
For pensions that means focusing on the two critical phases in the pensions life cycle: accumulation – when and how people save for retirement – and decumulation – what they do with those savings when they retire.
In both areas, we are driven by one overarching principle; to make markets work well.  To achieve a state of affairs where as many people as possible have an income in retirement that is adequate, or at least, in line with their expectations.
To do this, we need a few things:
to ensure, as far as possible, that consumers are engaged when making decisions
products that offer good value for money – healthy competition is a core part of this
savings that are invested appropriately – in line with the particular needs of that consumer.
There are, however, certain factors stand in the way of us achieving this goal
In particular, despite the boost provided by auto-enrolment, not enough people are putting money away or feel they have the money to put away. Our Financial Lives survey showed that just 35% of 45 to 54 year olds have given a significant amount of thought to how they will manage in retirement. Meanwhile, low interest rates make getting good returns harder.
So we have to make sure industry is helping consumers grow and use the savings they do have. Fees and charges matter disproportionately here. We need competitive markets that provide useful services at competitive prices – and we need consumers to trust them so they are willing to invest their money.
Regulating for this requires us to take on broad challenges, and because of our competition powers, almost unique for a financial regulator, we are well placed to do this.
One clear example is our Asset management market study. Published last year, it showed that the way asset managers compete, the role of intermediaries in helping investors choose between providers and investors’ limited awareness of charges all undermine competition in the sector.
Seemingly small percentage differences between charges make a huge difference in asset management, so consumer engagement is especially important here.
For example, paying a fee of 0.25% versus one of 1% on an investment of £20,000 means your pot will grow by an extra £14,000 over the course of 20 years, based on average UK equity market returns.
So we proposed a series of remedies aimed at enhancing protections for investors, providing them with greater clarity over what they’re actually buying and improving their understanding around what they’re paying for it.
As well as tackling broad challenges, we take targeted interventions where there’s a specific risk of consumer harm. Take our Retirement outcomes review, published at the end of last month.
Launched just over a year after the pension freedoms were introduced, the review examines how the market is evolving to identify any emerging issues, focusing in particular on consumers who do not take regulated advice.
We found that while many consumers have welcomed the freedom to access their savings in ways they previously couldn’t, they need further support to make the most of that flexibility.
Perhaps this isn’t surprising. The pensions market is complex and questions like which provider to use, where to invest your remaining pot and how quickly to drawdown require careful thought and consideration. For people with busy lives and full plates, such decisions can just seem too difficult.
As a result, many consumers who don’t take advice are ending up in investments that may not be right for them, including in cash – which, while seemingly the most straightforward option, runs the risk of erosion by inflation. A third of non-advised consumers in drawdown are wholly holding cash, over half of whom are at risk of losing out on income in retirement.
This matters. Our evidence suggests that if firms helped consumers navigate these decisions – for example through offering a more structured set of options - investment outcomes could be significantly improved.
For example, consumers in cash could increase the income from their pot by up to 37% over 20 years by moving to a mix of assets. Another worry is that consumers are paying too much in charges because they’re not shopping around, which, in turn, reduces the competitive pressure on firms.
In response, we’re proposing a package of remedies designed to improve consumer engagement, promote competition and protect consumers from poor outcomes. We are also working with the Pensions Regulator on a strategic approach to the pensions and retirement income sector, which we intend to publish later this year.
At the heart of this is the recognition that we have to respond to consumer behaviour as it is, not as traditional economics tells us it should be.
To quote Nobel prize winner Richard Thaler, “We do not play chess as if we were a grandmaster [or] invest as if we were Warren Buffett'.
As Thaler and other behavioural economists have shown, consumers don’t behave like purely rational beings found in traditional economic texts.
So pragmatism is at the heart of our remedies package. For example, we are proposing that the ‘wake-up packs’ consumers receive before deciding on a retirement product include a one-pager with all the essential information they need – because behavioural trials have shown us that this increases engagement.
We are also challenging firms to ensure they offer the products that consumers need. The financial services sector is constantly changing in line with the society it serves. Part of our role is being alive to these changes, and responding to them swiftly. Our Platforms market study is an example of this.
In the last few years, we’ve seen new investors being increasingly drawn to platforms, with Assets under Administration (AUA) almost doubling to £497bn. Given this trajectory, it was crucial we got under the skin of investment platforms and address any emerging issues before they become embedded.
Our interim findings suggest competition is working well for most. However, there are five specific groups for whom this may not be the case. This includes customers who may be losing out on interest or investment returns through holding large cash balances and those who find it difficult or costly to switch. Overall, we found that the barriers to switching are significant – potentially lessening the pressure on firms to offer value for money.
So we’re proposing a package of remedies aimed at protecting customers and improving competition.
Examples include ensuring that platforms alert consumers holding large cash balances and looking into reducing switching costs, potentially through banning exit fees.
Conclusion
All this work – the Asset management market study, the Retirement outcomes review and the Platforms market study – is driven by our aim to ensure consumers have the best outcomes possible in retirement.
But this aim, good outcomes in retirement, will be influenced by an array of factors – from economic trends to demographic shifts – that are not in our power to control.
The intergenerational question will define policymaking for years to come. And the trends we’re seeing today will play out over decades.
Later this year we are going to publish a paper on intergenerational issues, which will:
examine the challenges I've highlighted today in more detail
analyse how the financial services market may respond to those issues
identify any barriers which are preventing the market from innovating and meeting changing consumer demand
Where we can, we’re committed to taking timely, targeted action that makes a real difference in consumers’ lives.
The FCA’s role within this complex and ever-changing panorama is a significant but specific one.

FCA proposes actions to improve competition in the investment platform market,Press Releases,16/07/2018,16/07/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-proposes-actions-improve-competition-investment-platform-market,"However, the FCA’s interim findings reveal concerns about how platforms compete for particular groups of consumers. Given the rapid growth in this market, the FCA is proposing measures to address these problems before they get bigger.
With £500bn of assets under management, the investment platforms market has almost doubled in size since 2013. During the same period, an extra 2.2 million customer accounts were opened. As consumers become increasingly dependent on investment platforms to manage their investments it is vital that competition between platforms is working well. 
Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA said:
“This is a market that has seen significant growth in the past five years with more customers than ever deciding to use a platform to manage their money.  We know that competition is working well for many but it is important that the problems we have identified are addressed so that consumers don’t lose out.
“We have outlined a package of measures today to address the issues we have found, but we also want to see the industry step up, making it easier for consumers to transfer from one platform to another.'
The FCA has found that competition is not working as well as it should do for some consumers. The FCA is concerned about consumers:
Who may benefit from switching but find it difficult or costly to do. The FCA found that around 7% of all consumers tried to switch but failed to do so. The FCA found that barriers to switching are significant and could limit the pressure on platforms to provide continued value for money.
Using direct-to-consumers (D2C) platforms who particularly want to choose on the basis of price. The FCA found that it is difficult for consumers to choose a D2C platform on the basis of price and that those who want to don’t always succeed in finding cheaper platforms. The FCA found fees were hard to understand and compare.
Who use model portfolios. Similar risk labels are applied to very different portfolios and customers may have the wrong idea about the likely risk/returns they face. The FCA found the information that platforms provide about these model portfolios makes comparison difficult, and similar sounding labels (for example, ‘cautious’, ‘conservative’, ‘balanced’) can expose investors to significantly different underlying assets and volatility in returns.
Customers with large cash balances who may not be aware they are missing out on investment returns or on the interest they forego by holding cash this way.
Orphan clients, customers who were previously advised but no longer have any relationship with a financial adviser. Orphan clients have limited ability to access and alter their investments on an adviser platform so are effectively paying for functionality that they cannot use.
The FCA has proposed a package of remedies targeted at these five groups of consumers to address the concerns that it has identified. These include measures to help strengthen the extent to which platforms drive competition between asset managers, measures to make it easier for investors and advisers to switch platforms, tackling price discrimination between orphan and existing clients and measures to alert customers who are holding large cash balances.
The FCA recognises that industry is currently taking steps, including implementation of MiFID II, to help consumers shop around on the basis of price. The FCA also acknowledges that the Transfers and Re-registration Industry Group is currently taking forward an initiative to improve the switching process and reduce transfer times. 
Between interim and final report the FCA will assess industry progress in these areas before deciding whether it should introduce additional remedies. 
The FCA is seeking feedback on its initial findings and proposed remedies before publishing its final conclusions about the market in early 2019.
Notes to editors
MS17/1: Investment platforms market study
The FCA defines a platform service as a service which involves arranging, safeguarding, administering investments and distributing retail investment products which are offered to retail clients by more than one product provider. The service is neither solely paid for by adviser charges nor ancillary to the activity of managing investments for the retail client. See the FCA Handbook.
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

Interest rate benchmark reform: transition to a world without LIBOR,Speeches,12/07/2018,12/07/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/interest-rate-benchmark-reform-transition-world-without-libor,"Speaker: Andrew Bailey, Chief ExecutiveEvent: Bloomberg, LondonDelivered: 12 July 2018Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version
Highlights
Why firms need to end their reliance on LIBOR by end-2021.
Why overnight risk-free rates (RFRs) are the right foundation for interest rate markets.
The progress made on transition to these overnight risk-free rates and the work that remains to be done.
Introduction
When I spoke about LIBOR in July last year, I made clear the need to transition away from LIBOR before end-2021. The importance of doing so has not changed.
Today, one year closer to that end-2021 date, I would like to talk about what the world of interest rate benchmarks after LIBOR will look like. The Financial Stability Board, drawing on work done by its Official Sector Steering Group (OSSG), which I have the honour of co-chairing with Jay Powell of the Federal Reserve, has today published a statement on the future roles for overnight RFRs and term rates. I will set out some of the progress made on the transition to that future world. I will cover what has been achieved in the year that has passed, and what remains to be done.
Ensuring that the transition from LIBOR to alternative interest rate benchmarks is orderly will contribute to financial stability. Misplaced confidence in LIBOR’s survival will do the opposite, by discouraging transition. 
I hope it is already clear that the discontinuation of LIBOR should not be considered a remote probability 'black swan' event. Firms should treat it is as something that will happen and which they must be prepared for. Ensuring that the transition from LIBOR to alternative interest rate benchmarks is orderly will contribute to financial stability. Misplaced confidence in LIBOR’s survival will do the opposite, by discouraging transition. 
There is some good news to report on the important steps taken towards transition. But the pace of that transition is not yet fast enough. There is much further to go.
The case to replace LIBOR
One might consider that the likelihood that this rate will stop would be incentive enough, but I want to begin by setting out the case, indeed the need, to move away from LIBOR. LIBOR, or the London Interbank Offered Rate to give its previous full name, is intended to measure the rate at which banks could borrow funds in the wholesale markets. It was the rate structure for the eurocurrency markets when such things existed as distinct parts of the overall system. There are a number of reasons why LIBOR has become a problem.
First, financial markets have changed, and LIBOR has not been able to keep up with that change. The international interbank market has dwindled substantially. There are several reasons for this. In the shorter-term – post the financial crisis – bank funding has switched away from this interbank market.
Second, the longer-term reason is that the eurocurrency markets no longer exist as a distinct entity. There is a very important point here. The so-called euromarkets lived in an era where it was assumed that they were separate from domestic financial markets. The latter were where domestic monetary policy was set, central banks operated, and were the home of government bond markets. So, naturally, risk-free rates which are rooted in the credit standing and policy institutions of the domestic state, were a feature of domestic financial markets and not the euromarkets. LIBOR was not a risk-free rate, rather, it became a proxy for risk-free rates plus a measure of bank risk. From that, concepts like the TED spread, the US Treasury to Eurodollar spread, emerged as proxies of banking system risk. A problem which resulted – and it is striking with the benefit of hindsight to think how long and to what an extent this has gone on – is that LIBOR came to be used to price much of the interest rate derivatives market, even as that derivatives market expanded far beyond hedges for the euromarkets. Logically a risk-free rate should have been used. I say this because an important reason for reform is to correct this situation.
The third and fourth reasons that LIBOR has become a problem are powerful but shorter to describe. The third is that since banks do not lend to each other much these days on an unsecured basis, and the market is not returning, LIBOR is measuring the rate at which banks are not borrowing from one another. To do this, the system relies on the so-called expert judgement of the panel banks. It is esoteric to say the least to ask and answer the question, were I to borrow, which I am not doing, what might the interest rate be? But, more fundamentally, what is such a rate representative of? And that is critical because to continue in the now regulated world of benchmarks, LIBOR has to be representative. I struggle to see the case for this judgement.
The fourth problem is that since the system for quoting rates and thus constructing LIBOR is fragile, it is more vulnerable to misconduct. But let me be clear, I do not believe there is misconduct today. My point is that the system is more vulnerable to it. This is the case for acting to replace LIBOR.
Progress – what have we done in the past year?
Already by last summer working groups in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan had chosen their alternatives to LIBOR in the form of SOFR, SONIA and TONA. In October, Switzerland’s National Working Group recommended SARON as alternative to Swiss franc LIBOR.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR on 3 April. Futures contracts were offered by CME Group one month later, and LCH has just begun offering clearing of overnight index swaps (OIS) and basis swaps based on SOFR. Although these markets will take time to develop fully, SOFR futures are off to a faster start than the start to eurodollar futures. On average, there is already about US$5 billion in daily volume of trading, with open interest recently reaching over 12 thousand contracts.
The first SARON transactions took place on a bilateral basis in April 2017. In autumn 2017, LCH and Eurex started to offer clearing of SARON-referencing swaps. While notional volumes are still small, growth in transaction numbers is encouraging, and a valuable pre-requisite for transition.
SONIA has been actively used for many years, but in April this year the Bank of England began publishing a reformed and strengthened SONIA. It is now supported by an average of 370 transactions per day, compared with 80 before the reform. By comparison, the average daily count of deposit transactions that would potentially qualify as inputs to six month LIBOR – the most commonly used of the sterling LIBOR rates – was just 2 in the past 6 months. LIBOR could not achieve the same robustness as SONIA even if the LIBOR panels included all banks in the market. SONIA, unlike LIBOR, does not use, and has no reliance on submissions based on expert judgement.
Both ICE and the LSE now offer trading in SONIA futures contracts. And at the end of June, SONIA-referencing Overnight Index Swaps (OIS) had an 18% share of the overall cleared sterling interest rate swaps market on a duration adjusted basis, up from 14% in March, and 11% a year ago. In purely notional terms, an average of £5.5 trillion of SONIA cleared OTC derivatives were transacted in each of the past 3 months, up from £1.5 trillion a year earlier. Some of this reflects hedging against expectations of policy rate changes. But the increase is also at the long-end of the market, where the SONIA share was previously negligible.
And at the end of June, SONIA-referencing Overnight Index Swaps (OIS) had an 18% share of the overall cleared sterling interest rate swaps market on a duration adjusted basis, up from 14% in March, and 11% a year ago.
Also in June, the European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a £1 billion SONIA-linked bond – the first SONIA floating rate note since 2010. It was significantly oversubscribed.
The Working Groups that chose the preferred RFRs here in the United Kingdom, in the United States, and in Switzerland, have expanded their mandates and membership to focus on transition. Japanese authorities are also finalising their plans to bring together market participants to discuss transition to TONA, where appropriate.
The sterling group working on transition to SONIA now directly involves over 100 firms and trade associations across its central Working Group, sub-groups and other fora. The membership of the Group has been expanded to buy-side and non-financial firms. This mandate covers not only derivatives markets, but also cash markets. Sub-groups have been launched to consider transition issues in the bond markets, syndicated loan markets, and for pensions and insurance firms.
In autumn last year, the European Central Bank (ECB), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), European Commission and Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority announced the launch of a similar working group to identify and encourage adoption of an overnight risk-free rate.
The ECB’s Governing Council further announced it would begin publication in 2019 of an overnight euro rate – called ESTER – a sister to SONIA – based on wholesale unsecured overnight borrowing transaction data collected by the eurosystem.
ESTER is one of 3 candidates that could be chosen by the euro RFR Working Group as its preferred rate. The consultation to inform this choice closes tomorrow. This work is motivated in the main by needing to have robust alternatives to Euribor and EONIA, but it is helpful in the context of the less used Euro LIBOR too. Once this euro RFR is in place, all 5 of the remaining LIBOR currencies will have a robust RFR alternative.
There has also been important progress on amending contractual documentation to reduce the risks of disruption or contract frustration where contracts do reference LIBOR. There has hitherto been too much complacency about how these contracts would operate at the point LIBOR disappears. The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) has produced suggested documentation for securitisations, and the Loan Market Association (LMA) has done the same for syndicated loans, in conjunction with the Sterling RFR Working Group. Similar work is being undertaken in the Working Group’s Bond Market sub-group for floating rate bonds.
Today, ISDA is launching a consultation on how to make derivatives contracts more robust to IBOR discontinuation. For the reasons set out in the FSB’s statement, this consultation rightly points to the overnight RFRs identified by the various Working Groups as the foundation for a fall back rate in these contracts. It also addresses the question of how a fair and appropriate spread would be added to those RFRs to capture the term credit premium within IBOR rates. The FSB statement reflects the collective determination of authorities across the globe. In addition to that statement, and ISDA's consultation, stakeholders in LIBOR will also want to take careful note of Chris Giancarlo and fellow Commissioners' remarks at the CFTC's Market Risk Advisory Committee this afternoon.
In sum, across all the LIBOR currencies, important and encouraging progress has been made.
What remains to be done?
But it is still early days. As the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee has noted, the amount of contracts referencing LIBOR but maturing beyond end-2021 continues to grow.
Approximately US$170 trillion of the interest rate swap contracts cleared by LCH reference LIBOR, and a little under one-third of these, by notional, mature after end-2021. While robust fall back clauses added to these contracts through ISDA protocols can reduce risks of contract frustration, a smoother path to transition will be the gradual variation or replacement of these contracts, perhaps through multilateral compression and conversion exercises. This is something that both the sterling RFR Working Group and the US Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) are now beginning to consider.
Cash markets are still at a very early stage in transition. While the EIB’s SONIA-referencing bond issue has shown the feasibility of issuing a floating rate note referencing SONIA, we understand that some firms require system changes to manage bonds and loans where interest payments are calculated at the end of the reference period.
Some parts of bond, loan and securitisation markets have economic or operational preferences for 'forward-looking' term rates. Because current processes in these markets assume such forward-looking term rates, some participants are uncertain about how overnight RFRs would fit in their business models. This leaves them unclear how transition away from LIBOR will happen.
That highlights an important next step for transition, the exploration of the potential to create forward-looking term rates based on the RFRs. The sterling Risk Free Rate Working Group will next week launch a landmark consultation on this. Switzerland’s National Working Group is also discussing options for term rates based on SARON. And the ARRC in the United States has included the production of this kind of term rate as the final step in its paced transition plan.
Overnight and term rates
There is substantial consensus that the largest part of the market currently relying on LIBOR – that is the bulk of interest rate derivatives – does not need term rates. This part of the market is focused on hedging the general level of interest rates rather than term bank credit risk. It is already able to operate from a risk management perspective with the overnight risk-free rates, compounded where appropriate.
Because term rates are not needed for the bulk of the derivatives market, and because the overnight RFRs are likely to be the most robust interest rate benchmarks available – since they are firmly grounded in transactions – we expect that liquidity in interest rate derivative markets will in future be OIS-based, ie, directly linked to the overnight RFRs.
It is probable that with future liquidity in swaps and futures centred on these overnight RFRs, so that spreads are tightest and hedges cheapest in these RFR-based derivatives, there will be powerful incentives for other instruments, including bonds and securitisations, also to reference the overnight RFRs.
But, as I noted, we also hear demand in cash markets for forward-looking term rates, perhaps especially in respect of smaller and medium-sized issuers, and in syndicated loan markets, where parties may decide that knowing coupon or interest payments in advance is more important to them than a few basis points in spread. Hence our support for the development of forward-looking term rates derived from the RFRs.
The FSB statement sets out the consensus view that for derivatives markets which can no longer rely on an IBOR, the right choice, whether for transition or for fall back clauses, is, in most cases, the overnight RFRs. Any other choice would risk moving the bulk of current exposures referencing term IBOR benchmarks that are not sufficiently anchored in transactions to alternative term reference rates that may also suffer from thin underlying markets. This would not be effective in reducing risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system.
The FSB recognises, however, that there is a case for use of forward-looking term rates, particularly in cash markets. There is potential to create them on a stronger footing than LIBOR if they are anchored in liquid RFR-swaps or futures markets with healthy volumes of transactions and actionable quotes. 
This is the context for the sterling Working Group’s forthcoming consultation on term SONIA reference rates. The consultation will seek views on a number of practical ways to develop term rates and I encourage market participants to work towards this objective. Once available, these term rates can play an important role in facilitating LIBOR transition, particularly in loan and debt capital markets.
It is quite feasible that we will in future see 2 centres of gravity in interest rate reference rates – the largest one, used in the bulk of interest rate derivatives, will likely be around overnight RFRs. But a segment of cash markets, and perhaps a small part of the derivatives market which directly hedges cash market instruments, may prefer term rates. Where the term rate also has the overnight RFR as its core, this will facilitate hedging with minimal basis risk.
Those for whom forward-looking term rates are not necessary or desirable, should not wait for their arrival. But the work to develop new forward-looking RFR-derived term rates could be a useful facilitator of transition in cash markets.
How do we transition to a world without LIBOR?
Fall back language to support contract continuity or enable conversion of contracts if LIBOR ceases is an essential safety net – a 'seat belt' in case of a crash when LIBOR reaches the end of the road.
But fall backs are not designed as, and should not be relied upon, as the primary mechanism for transition. The wise driver steers a course to avoid a crash rather than relying on a seatbelt. That means moving to contracts which do not rely on LIBOR and will not switch reference rates at an unpredictable time.
The smoothest and best means for this transition is to start moving away from LIBOR in new contracts. The signs of growing liquidity in SONIA markets, and the publication and growth of markets in SOFR and SARON mean real alternatives are available.
It will also be important to look for ways of reducing exposure to LIBOR in legacy contracts, where practicable. This might be through multilateral compression and conversion exercises in derivative markets, or when loan contracts come up for renewal, renegotiation or roll-over, taking the opportunity to move from LIBOR to alternative benchmarks.
What about legacy contracts?
Those who do have practicable ways of converting their contracts from LIBOR to other reference rates, or at least adding fall backs into those contracts, should be able to identify a transition path – even if it is one with organisational, operational and other challenges.
What about where it is impractical to convert? For example, bonds with hundreds of holders, where unanimous or majority consent is required to change the terms of bonds.
It is easy to see why there is some hope that at least some panel banks could be persuaded to continue to contribute to LIBOR for a further period. We should not rely on that.
Nor at this stage would I rely on creating a 'synthetic' LIBOR – not reliant on bank submissions – to assist with the legacy issue. Let me explain these conclusions.
Can LIBOR continue on the current basis?
Hoping for continued panel bank submissions to LIBOR might seem like an easy way out. It is not. There are already too few transactions to support a benchmark as robust as we would like it to be.
Hoping for continued panel bank submissions to LIBOR might seem like an easy way out. It is not.
Every panel bank departing the LIBOR panels after end-2021 will make the underlying weakness of LIBOR worse. There will be fewer transactions still. It will become even less representative of an underlying market. This will – or should – add to the discomfort of those relying on the rate. Every panel bank departure will make the case for transition more compelling and more urgent. A LIBOR limping on with fewer and fewer panel banks is an unattractive prospect.
LIBOR must be sufficiently representative of the economic reality it intends to measure. This is a regulatory requirement under the EU’s Benchmark Regulation, and for good reason. We do not want a repeat of the problems we previously experienced with this benchmark.
One way in which the future of LIBOR could unfold is that either the administrator of LIBOR, or we, as supervisor, judges that LIBOR is no longer sufficiently representative, and so no longer satisfies the requirements of the Benchmark Regulation.
While it is possible that LIBOR production would cease at this point, the Regulation does not prohibit its continued publication in this circumstance. The provisions of the Benchmark Regulation can allow for continued publication to prevent frustration or breach of legacy contacts. That would mean that for a wide range of activities, including bond issuance and new derivatives contracts, supervised firms in the European Union, including financial institutions, exchanges, trading facilities and clearing houses, could only use the LIBOR rate for legacy contracts, but not for new business.
This prohibition for new business but permission for legacy may offer some comfort to those with no way of amending their contracts that reference LIBOR. But it also poses a question for those who, understandably and probably wisely, would want their contracts to fall back to an alternative interest rate benchmark at this point. The restriction on new trades would have a major impact also on the ability to manage and hedge legacy portfolios, with impacts on liquidity or even availability of pricing. I encourage those writing fall back provisions to consider this scenario carefully.
Could a synthetic LIBOR help?
One obvious question is whether LIBOR could be created by a means other than panel bank submission, for example by adding appropriate term credit spreads to overnight RFRs.
It is difficult, however, to see how the term credit premia that LIBOR seeks to measure, but for which the active underlying transactions from which it can be measured are so few, can be obtained from other sources. We have not seen a compelling answer to how one-month, three-month, six-month and twelve-month term bank credit spreads can be reliably measured on a dynamic and daily basis. If this could be accomplished, it would probably already have been done. For this reason, we do not see synthetic solutions as a part of a long-term solution to evolving LIBOR.
Would a 'synthetic LIBOR', assembled from a Risk Free Rate and a reasonable credit spread be better than nothing for otherwise stranded legacy contracts? This is a similar idea, in substance, to the fall back ideas that ISDA are setting out in their consultation today. I said in March that we did not rule it out in principle. The analysis and feedback we have received so far is that even with the more limited ambition – a lifebuoy for legacy rather than a long-term future for LIBOR – it does not offer an easy solution. As in the ISDA consultation, the term credit spread would almost certainly need to be fixed rather than dynamic because of the lack of market to measure.
There is also the issue of how to address the term element of the risk-free interest rate. A calculation based on compounding of the realised overnight rate over the relevant term can work as a fall back to LIBOR in derivatives contracts in which arrangements for calculation of payment can also be amended. It is not clear how it could work more generally as a synthetic LIBOR. Many in cash markets would not be able to adjust their contracts or systems to accommodate this type of payment structure.
These are formidable difficulties. The administrator of the benchmark – in this case ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) – holds responsibility for changing input data or methodology where existing input data no longer adequately represents economic reality, consulting with users and stakeholders. It must maintain clear published arrangements that describe whether and how the benchmark is to be calculated when the quantity or quality of input data falls short. LIBOR users therefore need to ensure they are aware of IBA’s plans in this circumstance – its reduced submission policy. IBA has been clear to us that these arrangements are not a long-term plan to publish LIBOR for legacy users in the absence of panel bank submissions. It should be clear to current LIBOR users that they must not rest any hopes in a synthetic solution to continuing LIBOR publication. 
Conclusion
The absence of ways to remedy the current underlying weakness in LIBOR – the lack of transactions, the unattractive prospect of LIBOR limping on with fewer panel banks, and the significant problems associated with a synthetic LIBOR, all lead to the same conclusion. The best option is actively to transition to alternative benchmarks. The most effective way to avoid LIBOR-related risk is not to write LIBOR-referencing business.
This is why the work of the RFR Working Groups here and in other jurisdictions is so important. It aims to agree and make available conventions and standards that can help achieve our objective or ensuring financing and risk management are not interrupted when LIBOR disappears. Authorities will continue to support and facilitate that work. But ultimately it is the responsibility of each individual firm to address the risks which it faces.
Firms that we supervise will need to be able to demonstrate to FCA supervisors and their PRA counterparts that they have plans in place to mitigate the risks, and to reduce dependencies on LIBOR. Bill Dudley noted in May that Federal Reserve Bank supervisors would also be seeking to ensure that firms understand their LIBOR exposures and risks and are making commensurate efforts to address them.
Firms that we supervise will need to be able to demonstrate to FCA supervisors and their PRA counterparts that they have plans in place to mitigate the risks, and to reduce dependencies on LIBOR.
Some firms will also have obligations to disclose and consider risks to investors when they sell LIBOR-related instruments. Issuers of LIBOR-related listed securities, for example, owe duties of disclosure under prospectus requirements, and need to ensure these have been fulfilled. Banks and investment firms also need to consider the design and risks of any new LIBOR-referencing instruments as part of their product governance obligations, considering and describing the impact of LIBOR discontinuation on those instruments. And they will need to provide all appropriate information to all distributors of those financial instruments.
Those acting on behalf of investors will need to ensure they have considered and understand what will happen to LIBOR-referencing instruments in the event of LIBOR discontinuation. Investment advisors and portfolio managers may need to be able to show that they have considered whether such investments remain suitable for a particular client or portfolio if there is no clear and appropriate plan on what will happen in the event of discontinuation. Brokers or platforms offering non-advised services need to disclose to clients in an understandable way information on the key features and risks of financial instruments they make available. For an instrument relying on LIBOR beyond end-2021, the risk of discontinuation will need to be covered.
Well-prepared firms know this already. We are already seeing the necessary changes in prospectuses. We are seeing use of new fall back language in contracts. But surveys and feedback suggest too many firms are not yet adequately aware. They are not yet making or planning the necessary investments in preparing systems, processes and business practices for transition. The biggest obstacle to a smooth transition is inertia – a hope that LIBOR will continue, or that work on transition can be delayed or ignored. Misplaced confidence is a risk to financial stability as well as to individual firms.
But with investment in transition, we have the prospect of a future world in which widely-used interest rate benchmarks have the robustness previously found lacking in some IBORs. This is thanks to the collective work of many market participants and the strong consensus that has emerged in that work. Markets have worked successfully on firmly establishing overnight RFRs. This will provide a strong foundation for the future world. Important work on complementary new term rates based on those RFRs is also underway.
I would like to end by expressing my gratitude to the many firms and associations who are already committing their time and expertise to these cross-market efforts. I encourage those who have not yet done so to engage in the transition work, and the various consultations underway. And for firms who are not yet aware, not yet engaged, and without plans to address their LIBOR-related dependencies, I warn you again of the risks.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

MiFID II and the fight against financial crime,Speeches,11/07/2018,20/07/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/mifid-ii-and-fight-against-financial-crime,"Speaker: Mark Steward, Director of Enforcement and Market OversightLocation: LondonDelivered on: 3 July 2018
Highlights:
From 3 July, firms require Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) before they can trade on behalf of their clients. A LEI is a unique code, included in a global data system, which allows every legal entity or structure that is a party to a relevant financial transaction to be identified, no matter where it is located.
Since the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) commenced on 3 January 2018, our market data processor has ingested nearly 3.5 billion transaction reports, averaging over half a billion reports per month.
Using software developed in-house to normalise and ingest disparate order book data-sets from the main lit and dark UK trading venues, it is now possible to track potentially related trading activity on different venues and detect cross-market manipulation. 
We have commenced a small number of investigations into firms’ systems and controls where, for the first time, we have indicated to those firms that we are looking at whether there has been any misconduct that might justify a criminal prosecution under the Money Laundering Regulations. 
Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from delivered version.
Keeping our markets safe
Today marks an important step in the implementation of the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II). It is the first day in which Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) will be required before firms can trade on behalf of their clients, following a six-month implementation period. 
For those of you wondering, an LEI is a unique code that identifies legal entities or structures, including companies, charities and trusts trading on our markets. The code is included in a global data system and enables every legal entity or structure that is a party to a relevant financial transaction to be identified, no matter where it is located.
The requirement for LEIs is the result of one of the resolutions contained in the G20’s June 2012 Los Cabos Declaration which endorsed the Financial Stability Board (FSB) recommendation for the development of a global legal entity identifier for parties to financial transactions “with a global governance framework representing the public interest'. (G20 Leaders Declaration, 19-20 June 2012, Los Cabos, Mexico para 44).
We now have around 130,000 LEIs and over 2.3 million national identifiers that now form part of the MiFID II framework which commenced operation in January this year. 
I want to talk about the way in which identifiers will contribute to our work in keeping our markets safe from abuse and how this extends to tackling the emerging risk identified by the government in last October’s National risk assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing, in capital markets and our work here, as well as the importance of some very human capabilities in ensuring any system and control works well.
MiFID II
The change over the last 6 months has been significant.
Since MiFID II commenced on 3 January 2018, our market data processor has ingested nearly 3.5 billion transaction reports, averaging over half a billion reports per month. By contrast, for the first six months of 2017, the monthly average was around 390 million, representing an increase of over 55%.
Previously, we had 8 entities submitting transaction reports to the FCA on behalf of approximately 800 firms. We now have 23 entities submitting transaction reports to the FCA, including 7 Approved Reporting Mechanisms or ARMs (4 are UK authorised and three are European Economic Area authorised passporting the activity into UK); 10 are trading venues and there are six investment firms. Those 23 entities are submitting data on behalf of 3,150 executing firms of which 1,500 are UK firms subject to the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR) transaction reporting obligations. If we add the transaction reports routed to the FCA from other National Competent Authorities, this brings the total number of executing firms to over 6,000.
And the reports are providing a much more detailed, complex and clearer picture of the market, identifying the buyer, the seller, the decision maker (where applicable), the investment decision within the firm (either an individual trader or an algorithm) and the type of execution within the firm (either an individual trader or an algorithm). 
The additional data has identified a number of anomalies (and we do carry out quality checks) identifying individuals executing transactions who were apparently born in 1900.
We have invested heavily in our technical capacity to ingest, process and use all this information. We are processing 30 million transaction reports per day and we have planned for a 20% increase in capacity and processing of data over 5 years, although there is no upper limit on the ingestion or processing of this information. 
We are processing 30 million transaction reports per day and have planned for a 20% increase in capacity and processing of data over 5 years.
In this context, we are now also asking for and receiving, daily, order book and trade report data from 7 UK trading platform, processing approximately 140 million rows of data per day. There are approximately 70 billion rows of order and trade data currently being stored for FTSE 350 entities for the period January 2013 to April 2017.
This number is likely to increase significantly this year as we have now requested order book data for all FTSE and AIM stocks. Separately, we are also uploading all the data collected under MiFID I which constitutes approximately 20 billion rows of data.
Using software developed in-house to normalise and ingest disparate order book data-sets from the main lit and dark UK trading venues, it is now possible to track potentially related trading activity on different venues and detect cross-market manipulation (i.e. artificially influencing the price of a financial instrument in one market while benefiting in another). Previously this was effectively undetectable, at least not without enormous time and resource.
Global sharing
Importantly, the reports we are receiving are shared with our European colleagues via the European Securities and Markets Authority Transaction Reporting Exchange Mechanism (TREM), giving full value to the G20/FSB objective of identifiers for 'a global governance framework representing the public interest'.  More particularly, since January this year when Mifid II went live, we have routed over 3.1 billion transaction reports to other National Competent Authorities, noting that the same transaction report can be forwarded to multiple regulators. 
In this sense, the framework fosters collaboration across the EU, both now and after Brexit, and encourages local action in attacking global problems.
The framework reflects a global effort from firms as well as regulators, given the substantial investment the industry has made to comply with these requirements and to provide the data in the first place. These commitments and their performance by submitting firms demonstrates a shared obligation to ensure our markets work well, as free from financial crime and market abuse as possible.
All of this is enormously exciting and provides a strong foundation for some ambitious work, tackling cross-border market abuse, including insider dealing, as well as cross-market manipulation far more efficiently than ever before.
All of this is enormously exciting and provides a strong foundation for some ambitious work, tackling cross-border market abuse, including insider dealing, as well as cross-market manipulation far more efficiently than ever before. 
Money laundering in capital markets
Let me now focus on financial crime and money laundering in our markets. Last October, Her Majesty’s Treasury and the Home Office published the UK’s National risk assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing which included, for the first time, the emerging risk of money laundering in capital markets. 
We must act on this and we are.
We have several investigations on foot dealing directly with series of capital market transactions that appear to have no apparent market purpose or function. If our suspicions are right, not only do these transactions falsify liquidity, trading volume and supply and demand in the market, the purpose of these transactions is unrelated to the sale and purchase of the underlying instruments, begging very hard questions. The transactions in these cases also have cross-border elements and they are being conducted in association with regulators and law enforcement agencies both here and overseas.
We have also commenced a small number of investigations into firms’ systems and controls where, for the first time, we have indicated to those firms that we are looking at whether there has been any misconduct that might justify a criminal prosecution under the Money Laundering Regulations. 
I am conscious that starting criminal investigations against firms in relation to poor Anti Money Laundering systems and controls may draw some sharp intakes of breath.
I am conscious that starting criminal investigations against firms in relation to poor Anti Money Laundering systems and controls may draw some sharp intakes of breath.
First, the potential for criminal prosecutions for systems and controls failures under the Money Laundering Regulations is a consequence of the regulations themselves and is giving effect to the purpose and intention of the regulations.
Secondly, the prospect of investigations having a dual track, or potentially a multiplicity of outcomes, from no further action to disciplinary, civil or criminal proceedings, is not new and there is already a significant body of practice and procedure in relation to market abuse cases in which the same choices exist.
Thirdly, the fact that criminal proceedings may be brought doesn’t mean they will be brought. An investigation is primarily a fact-finding mission with any decision about what, if any, might result being best left until the end. In short, all the presumptions of innocence apply which is why these firms should not be identified unless and until any charges are laid.
Fourthly, any criminal proceeding will need to satisfy both the evidential test (beyond reasonable doubt) as well as the public interest test. In practice, this will mean that criminal action is likely to be reserved for the more serious cases. 
What will a serious case look like, I hear you ask? It is hard to be definitive. I doubt the depths of seriousness can be fully plumbed anyway. However, it would seem safe to say that where we see what appears to be facilitation of suspected serious crime, in circumstances where plainly obvious checks and questions have neither been carried out or asked, it is likely the test of seriousness will be passed.
In assessing what is plainly obvious, it is important for us to keep in view the significant difference between how something appears both with and without the benefit of hindsight. What is obvious depends on context. 
At the same time, the excuse of hindsight won’t protect a lack of rigour and discipline in the way systems and controls operate; nor the need to ensure systems operate according to their purpose; nor the importance of scepticism and rational intuition to challenge and to ask questions that should be asked and to detect.  
Scepticism, intuition and detection
Systems and controls will not work unless those systems inculcate the ability to ask the right question in a timely way, to be sceptical, to intuit and to stimulate both the ability and the desire to detect.
Professor Eugene Soltes, a professor at Harvard’s Business School, recently published the results of his study on why white-collar criminals do what they do. His book, ‘Why They Do It’ poses the question of why supposedly well educated, well-off, trusted individuals are tempted to lie, cheat or steal. Professor Soltes observes that many white collar criminal '..never deeply felt that the decisions [to commit crime] were actually harmful to themselves or others…' in part because they '…never need to get close – physically or psychologically – to their victims...'In other words, their capacity to understand or intuit the harmful consequences of their actions can be dulled by the fact those consequences are often extenuated by distance or circumstance.
In a subsequent magazine article, Prof Soltes wrote '….in this less intimate world, age-old intuitions are not always well suited to sense the kinds of potential harms that people can cause in the business world' (E Soltes, 14 December 2016, The Psychology of White Collar Criminal, The Atlantic). 
In other words, we don’t notice what we should. I think there is something in this. 
The maturation of systems and controls in firms, the development of global governance frameworks, like LEIs, are vitally important. They become our radar but, and this cannot be overestimated, they are not ends in themselves. Systems and controls helps us know where to look. To work well, we must ensure the clues are noticed, the questions are asked and those who turn the other way are made accountable.

How can we ensure that Big Data does not make us prisoners of technology?,Speeches,11/07/2018,11/07/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/how-can-we-ensure-big-data-does-not-make-us-prisoners-technology,"Speaker: Charles Randell, Chair, Financial Conduct Authority and Payment Systems RegulatorLocation: Reuters Newsmaker event, LondonDelivered on: 11 July 2018
Highlights:
Three factors could come together to make an algocracy more than just science fiction: Big Data, artificial intelligence and machine learning, behavioural science.
The power of Big Data corporations and their central place in providing services that are now essential in our everyday lives raise significant questions about the adequacy of global frameworks for competition and regulation.
We need to anticipate the fundamental questions which Big Data, artificial intelligence and behavioural science present, and make sure that we innovate ethically to shape the answers.
Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version.
Most of you will have interacted with several algorithms already today. In some cases, more algorithms than people. Algorithms are of course simply sets of rules for solving problems, and existed long before computers. But algorithms are now everywhere in digital services. An algorithm decided the results of your internet searches today. If you used Google Maps to get here, an algorithm proposed your route. Algorithms decided the news you read on your news feed and the ads you saw.
Algorithms decide which insurance and savings products you are offered on price comparison websites. Whether your job qualifies you for a mortgage. Perhaps, whether you are interviewed for your job in the first place. Algorithms may have helped you find your partner. Right now, your partner may be using an algorithm to find someone better.
This is why some have said that in the future we will live not in a democracy, where the citizens decide how we are governed, nor in a bureaucracy, where officials like me decide, but in an algocracy, where algorithms decide.
In the 1960s TV series The Prisoner, Patrick McGoohan plays a character who is abducted and held captive in an oppressive and surreal community called the Village, where the people have no names, just numbers. He is Number Six. It’s impossible to know whom he can trust and who or what the mysterious Number One is that sets the rules of the Village. He is subject to constant surveillance and manipulation.
How do we make sure that our financial future is not like the Village, governed by rules set by unaccountable data scientists, and implemented by firms who may not even understand how these algorithms reach their decisions?
Now, I want to argue today that we should be optimistic: advances in data science have already brought huge benefits to society, such as smarter ways of detecting financial crime and market abuse, cheaper and faster transactions and greater access to affordable financial advice and guidance. The UK FinTech industry is world leading and bursting with new ideas. But there is no room for complacency. Three factors could come together to make an algocracy more than just science fiction:
Big Data: rapid advances in the ability to store data cheaply have created enormous and detailed datasets about many different aspects of our lives. The largest of these datasets are held and controlled by a small number of big corporations. As we move towards the internet of things, where our cars, our homes, our electrical appliances, our watches, our fitbits and our phones produce more and more data, these datasets could explode further.
Artificial intelligence and machine learning: vast improvements in processing power means that corporations can mine these Big Data sets for patterns more effectively than ever before. Whereas in the past firms could only target broad groups of consumers, these patterns can now be turned into conclusions about us as individuals. They can make predictions about our future behaviour, and then decide which products and services we should be offered and on which terms.
Behavioural science: as firms understand more about human behaviour, they are able to target their sales efforts using ‘nudges’ which exploit our decision-making biases, informed by the Big Data about us that they hold. Some nudges may be in consumers’ interests, as with auto-enrolment for pensions, but there is the potential for them to be used against our interests too.
Number Six protests: ‘I am not a number – I am a free man!’ Today I want to set out some of the questions we need to debate and resolve if we are going to make sure that technological innovation remains a force for good in financial services and that it protects and enhances our freedom to make good decisions as people, not just numbers.
It's an important topic, given the UK’s global leadership in both technological innovation and financial services. If we can combine these skills with fair standards and with public trust, we can maximise the opportunities for the UK finance industry to succeed in the global market. And we can revolutionise the quality, price and accessibility of financial services for consumers.
Are we free?
The use of Big Data, automated decision-making and behavioural science is already raising some fundamental questions. To quote from Nicholas Carr’s book The Glass Cage: ‘Automation confronts us with the most important question of all: What does human being mean?’
The liberal approach to markets rests on the assumption that a consumer can and will make good choices if she is given fair disclosure; and that it is therefore fair to hold the consumer responsible for those choices. Indeed, the legislation under which the FCA and the Payment Systems Regulator operate requires us to have regard to the general principle that consumers should take responsibility for their decisions.
The liberal approach to markets rests on the assumption that a consumer can and will make good choices if she is given fair disclosure; and that it is therefore fair to hold the consumer responsible for those choices.
Increasingly this assumption is being called into question. It is certainly questionable where vulnerable consumers are involved. In their excellent book Scarcity, Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir document how poverty and other disadvantages can impose a ‘bandwidth tax’, reducing the ability of individuals to take responsibility for their decisions.  But biases affect all of us and are prevalent in our decisions about most if not all financial products. That’s why the FCA has for some years led the way among global conduct regulators in incorporating behavioural science into its regulatory toolkit.
Financial education is also important but it will never be a sufficient protection against firms selling bad financial products, particularly for those coping with a range of stresses in their lives.
And many, including the Financial Services Consumer Panel, have questioned the very foundation of informed consent on which online contracts, including contracts for the use of personal data, are built.
Research conducted in the US some 10 years ago estimated that if the typical individual using online services actually read the privacy policies before clicking ‘Agree’, she would spend around 250 hours per year doing so. That’s about 6 working weeks every year. Imagine how many weeks you would have to spend to read all the terms and conditions you click through today, given the growth of online services in the last 10 years.
The power of Big Data corporations and their central place in providing services that are now essential in our everyday lives raise significant questions about the adequacy of global frameworks for competition and regulation. The ordinary consumer may in practice have no choice in whether to deal with these corporations on terms which are non-negotiable and are often too general to be well understood. And without access to the data which consumers have signed – or clicked – away, new businesses may find it very difficult to compete.
If you add all these factors together, they call into question the adequacy of the traditional liberal approach to the relationship between financial services firms and their customers. And regulation is central because it will help define whether AI and Big Data liberate customers, or disenfranchise them.

Some real examples
If this all sounds a bit philosophical or theoretical it’s worth pausing to think about some real-world examples.
Some are good. Think services like microinsurance, where AI promises to increase coverage for people on low incomes by improving risk modelling. 
But some are potentially problematic.
The New York Times reported that some credit card companies in the US started cutting cardholders’ credit limits when charges appeared for marriage guidance counselling, since marriage breakdown is highly correlated with debt default.
There were a number of media reports earlier this year claiming that price comparison websites quoted significantly higher car insurance premiums for people with names suggesting they are members of ethnic minorities.  If that’s true, are they being treated as people, or as numbers – as mere data points?
And it’s well known that the FCA is concerned about firms using their predictions of customers’ propensity to shop around in imposing significant price rises on customers who do not. Not least because these customers may be vulnerable and such price rises may unfairly exploit that vulnerability.
Some may say ‘caveat emptor’, or ask why firms should not maximise their profits using all means at their disposal. But I don’t think that would be the prevailing view in our society.

We need to anticipate the fundamental questions which Big Data, artificial intelligence and behavioural science present, and make sure that we innovate ethically to shape the answers. Society in general and policy makers in particular need to think about how to mitigate the risk that an algocracy exacerbates social exclusion and worsens access to financial services in the way that it identifies the most profitable or the most risky customers. 
The foundations of good innovation: purpose, people and trust
I would like to suggest that the foundations of good innovation – innovation which benefits society and which will be sustainable – must have three elements: purpose, people and trust.
Purpose
The FCA has identified a firm’s purpose as perhaps the most important driver of the firm’s culture. Leaders of firms need to be clear about what their firm’s purpose is and to communicate it clearly throughout the organisation.
Purpose is the most important lens through which to examine technological innovation. Is the purpose of the firm, is the purpose of its innovations, to create long term value by helping consumers, or is it simply to maximise revenue by exploiting consumer bias? Value creation which helps consumers will be part of a sustainable business strategy. Maximising revenue by exploiting consumer bias is unlikely to last long; and it’s unlikely to end well.
The availability and use of very detailed personal data about consumers may even call the purpose of some existing business models into question. Insurance, for example, is about pooling risk. The social benefits of pooling may be eroded if insurance is ‘over-personalised’ and becomes unaffordable for people whose genetic inheritance identifies them as high risk. Equally, there is a danger, in time, of excluding those who have an impoverished data history and cannot provide the number of inputs the algorithm requires. 
On the other hand, new ways to explore existing datasets could open up financial services to those who have been excluded from them by traditional ways of making decisions. UK FinTech firms are already using transactional data to identify creditworthy loan and mortgage customers who would be excluded from these products by traditional credit scoring risk assessments because of irregular earnings histories or long periods of renting. The Treasury’s Rent Recognition Challenge produced some great ideas for harnessing FinTech to address financial exclusion, highlighting that Big Data can be profitable at the same time as it expands markets to serve a social purpose. 
People
The second element of the foundations for good technological innovation is people.
We must remember that however sophisticated automated processes may become, people must remain involved at all stages. We may one day face a world where machines can design and build more machines, but people will start that process and people must remain in charge and accountable. 
People must be at the centre of the firm’s purpose. People must be accountable for innovation through sound systems of risk management, governance and control. 
But putting people at the centre of things is not just a question of purpose and governance; it’s also a question of design. Technology needs to be implemented with human judgment in all aspects of its use. People, not machines, need to understand and control the outcomes that the technology they are designing is producing; people, not machines, have to make the judgment as to whether these outcomes are ethically acceptable – and ensure that they don’t just automate and intensify unacceptable human biases that created the data of the past. A strong focus on checking outcomes will be essential as some forms of machine learning, such as neural networks, may produce results through processes which cannot be fully replicated and explained.
There’s also a danger that the use of technology will degrade people’s willingness to judge and intervene, because they feel that they are less personally connected to consumers and consumer outcomes - the logic of the machine has taken over from individual responsibility. George Dyson asks the question: ‘What if the cost of machines that think is people that don’t?’ 
Rather as in the famous Milgram experiment, where the subjects who hesitated to inflict what they thought were electric shocks were told that ‘the experiment requires you continue’.  So firms need to anticipate the effect that more technology will have on their culture, and design systems to maintain good judgment. This includes promoting a culture in which individuals are willing to question the results of automation. As Donella Meadows has written, ‘Living successfully in a world of systems requires more of us than our ability to calculate. It requires our full humanity – our rationality, our ability to sort out truth from falsehood, our intuition, our compassion, our vision, and our morality.’ 
After all, key assets of the UK financial services industry are its accumulated human experience and the quality of its human judgments. We must not lose these.
Trust
The final element of the foundations we need to lead the world in financial innovation is trust.
Trust is the most important asset of any financial services business. The City of London Corporation launched its ‘Business of Trust’ campaign last year, highlighting the key elements of creating and maintaining trust.  Purpose and people are two of these, but creating and maintaining trust also requires that firms are part of the communities they serve, share society’s values and communicate well.
Firms need to be part of the communities they serve so that they can understand society’s views of the fair use of personal data. These views are complex and changing. You can’t design an algorithm which will tell you what is fair. It may be acceptable to use detailed data about people’s eating and drinking habits to price their health insurance, but is it fair to use that data to price their mortgage? These are incredibly difficult judgments which depend on context, and which require firms to be part of society so they know what society’s values are.
Firms need to be part of the communities they serve so that they can understand society’s views of the fair use of personal data.
Firms that are well connected to the values of society find it easier to articulate their own values, which in turn engender trust.
And finally, trust requires good communication so that consumers understand and accept a firm’s approach to using their data. By good communication, I don’t mean pages and pages of obscure disclosures, disclaimers and consents. I mean short and readable statements which make it clear what firms will and won’t do with their customers’ data. These need to be developed with consumers, not imposed on them. A number of firms do this already but many do not. Should all businesses have a data charter? Should these be developed through voluntary codes of practice? Will the industry take the lead or should they be a regulatory requirement?
Conclusion
It’s a great time for people to join this important debate because there is so much more thinking to be done. Technological innovation in financial services brings together two of the UK’s greatest assets and gives us the opportunity to lead the world in FinTech. I would like the UK regulatory community to add another asset – the leadership in regulation that it has already shown through programmes like the FCA’s Project Innovate and the Sandbox, while safeguarding high standards of consumer protection. The UK already has a trusted legal and regulatory system and contributes to setting global standards of corporate governance and business ethics.  We need to contribute to new standards for data ethics too. The FCA and the PSR are fully supportive of the government’s proposals to establish a Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation to ensure that the UK sets the highest standards for ethical conduct in harnessing the power of Big Data.
The financial world is currently full of exciting new ideas. But sustainable financial innovation will be built on purpose, people and trust, which have been the key ingredients of the best financial businesses for centuries. And in that sense - if in no other - Mark Twain was right to say: ‘There is no such thing as a new idea’.
I am very grateful to Andrew Bailey, Chris Woolard, Tom Matthews and Ian Runacres for their comments on this speech. Nevertheless, views expressed in this speech are personal and do not necessarily reflect the views of any of the above people or of the FCA or PSR.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Christopher Woolard’s statement welcoming the IDWG recommendations,Statements,05/07/2018,05/07/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/christopher-woolard-statement-welcoming-idwg-recommendations,"We would like to thank the members of the Group, including the Chair Dr Chris Sier and the co-deputy Chairs Jeff Houston and Gregg McClymont. We would also like to thank all of those stakeholders who participated in their work.
We welcome the recommendations and the FCA will continue to work with investors and industry to play our part in the next steps as recommended in the IDWG report.
Our response to the recommendations and next steps
We welcome the recommendations made by the IDWG. We believe that the group has made significant progress in tackling the issues we found in relation to institutional disclosure as part of the Asset Management Market Study.
We will now work with interested parties to begin the process of supporting these recommendations. We will continue to work with investor and industry representatives as well as other regulators with an interest in this space.
As part of the recommendations the IDWG has encouraged the formation of a group to own the outputs of the work so far and be able to answer questions and monitor the use of the templates. We are working with interested bodies and anticipate the new group will be formed over the summer with launch planned for autumn. The full IDWG report, including the templates, will be released once the new group has been convened. 
We will reconsider the issue of disclosure to institutional investors in the future if we have any reason to be concerned about the effectiveness of how the IDWG recommendations have played out in the market.
The recommendations
The IDWG has provided us with a full report of their recommendations, and the supporting tools, documents and templates. The IDWG also provided us with their views on how to maximise the effectiveness of the recommendations, how to encourage providers to use the templates and how to encourage more users to request information on costs and charges from their providers using the templates. The report also represents how discussion on key issues evolved.
A summary of the IDWG recommendations can be found on the IDWG webpage, which also includes links to other relevant information, including summary minutes from IDWG meetings.
Background
We launched the IDWG as part of the Asset Management Market Study remedies package.
We want to see more consistent and standardised disclosure of costs and charges to institutional investors. We think a standardised disclosure template should provide institutional investors with a clearer understanding of the costs and charges for a given fund or mandate. This should allow investors to compare charges between providers and give them a clear expectation of the disclosure they can expect. We appointed Dr Chris Sier to chair a working group of industry and investor representatives on institutional disclosure, with a view to agreeing a template. The IDWG recommendations to us sit alongside and support several other recent interventions which should also impact the way institutional investors interact with their asset manager.
The main focus of the IDWG has been on the provision of helpful information to assist institutional investors by detailing what costs they are paying. It has not focused specifically on creating a method of delivering compliance with MiFID and other requirements. However the IDWG templates have been designed to be aligned with the relevant disclosure obligations in MiFID II. So while firms must continue to ensure that they individually meet all relevant regulatory requirements, if these templates are completed in a comprehensive and accurate way, including all costs and associated charges, the information in the templates should assist firms in meeting those requirements.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Building the UK financial sector’s operational resilience discussion paper,Press Releases,05/07/2018,05/07/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/building-uk-financial-sector%E2%80%99s-operational-resilience-discussion-paper,"It envisages that boards and senior management can achieve better standards of operational resilience through increased focus on setting, monitoring and testing specific impact tolerances for key business services, which define the amount of disruption that could be tolerated.
The challenges for operational resilience have become even more demanding given a hostile cyber-environment and large scale technological changes. As recent disruptive events illustrate, operational resilience is a vital part of protecting the UK’s financial system, institutions and consumers.
An operational disruption such as one caused by a cyber-attack, failed outsourcing or technological change could impact financial stability by posing a risk to the supply of vital services on which the real economy depends, threaten the viability of individual firms and FMIs, and cause harm to consumers and other market participants in the financial system. This DP focuses on how the provision of these products and services can be maintained within reasonable tolerances regardless of the cause of disruption. It reinforces the need for firms and FMIs to develop and improve response capabilities so that any wider impact of disruptive events is contained. The speed and effectiveness of communication with the people and institutions most affected, in particular customers, should be at the forefront of every firm’s response.
Motivating the approach are a number of important concepts, which include:
focusing on the continuity of the most important business services as an essential component of managing operational resilience
setting board-approved impact tolerances which quantify the level of disruption that could be tolerated
planning on the assumption that disruption will occur as well as seeking to prevent it
The approach to operational resilience set out in this DP is consistent with the Financial Protection Committee's (FPC) recent plans to establish its tolerance for disruption to financial services from cyber incidents, with both focusing on continuity of business services. The supervisory authorities may expect some firms and FMIs to consider the FPC’s impact tolerance when they set their own tolerances.
The supervisory authorities are encouraging responses to questions posed in the DP from all types of firms and FMIs, trade associations, consumer bodies, individuals and businesses as users of financial services, and especially those who have suffered harm from disruptive events.
The discussion period ends on 5 October 2018.

FCA clarifies fairer treatment of regular premium PPI complaints,Press Releases,04/07/2018,04/07/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-clarifies-fairer-treatment-regular-premium-ppi-complaints,"In March 2017 the FCA made rules in relation to the Supreme Court judgment in Plevin. That judgment and the rules say that a lender’s failure to disclose at point of sale a large commission payable out of the PPI premium can make the lender’s relationship with the consumer unfair under the Consumer Credit Act.   
The FCA’s proposed guidance deals with an uncertainty that has emerged since the rules were made. The guidance clarifies that firms should assess commission disclosures not only at the point of sale but on an on-going basis, and that this should be assessed under our general complaint handling rule.
Jonathan Davidson, Executive Director of Supervision – Retail and Authorisations at the FCA said:
“This consultation provides guidance on how to ensure fair and consistent outcomes for regular premium PPI complaints. It supports our aim of bringing the PPI issue to an orderly conclusion in a way that secures appropriate protection for consumers and enhances the integrity of the UK financial system.' 
The consultation closes on 4 September 2018 and FCA will consider the feedback received.
If the FCA decide to proceed, it will issue a policy statement with finalised guidance in late autumn 2018, with an immediate implementation date.
What should consumers do?
Consumers who previously made a complaint about regular premium PPI and had it rejected will be able to make a new complaint to their lender.
Consumers should consider and decide whether they want to make a complaint before the 29 August 2019 deadline.

FCA reveals the fourth round of successful firms in its regulatory sandbox,Press Releases,03/07/2018,24/08/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-reveals-fourth-round-successful-firms-its-regulatory-sandbox,"The regulatory sandbox allows firms to test innovative products, services or business models in a live market environment, while ensuring that appropriate protections are in place. It is part of Innovate, an initiative kicked off in 2014 to promote competition in the interest of consumers. Since its inception Innovate has had over 1200 applications and has supported more than 500 firms. The sandbox was a first for regulators worldwide, underlining the FCA’s commitment to innovation in financial services.
Christopher Woolard, executive director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA, said:
“I am pleased to say that this is the largest sandbox cohort to date with a record number of applicants meeting our eligibility criteria. Cohort 4 has seen a large increase in the number of firms testing wholesale propositions including firms that are aiming to increase the efficiency of the capital-raising process. Alongside these we can see significant use of distributed ledger technology (DLT), some experimentation with cryptoassets which will help inform our policy work and propositions aimed at helping lower income consumers.'
Cohort 4
The FCA received 69 applications to cohort four of the regulatory sandbox, an increase on the number of applications to cohort three. 29 firms will proceed to test.
As with the previous cohorts, the FCA continues to see successful applications from a diverse range of sectors, locations and firm sizes. Areas covered include consumer credit, automated advice and travel insurance.
Eight firms (27%) are operating in the wholesale sector. This is a large increase on cohort 3 where we had three firms with wholesale propositions. Five large firm tests will be conducted in cohort 4; the largest number to date.
Over 40% of companies accepted to cohort four are using DLT. Of these, six are using DLT to automate the issuance of debt or equity. Two are using DLT to support the provision of insurance. Other technology applied includes geo-location technology, use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and artificial intelligence.
We have accepted a small number of firms that will be testing propositions relating to cryptoassets. We are keen to explore whether, in a controlled environment, consumer benefits can be delivered while effectively managing the associated risks.
The current cohort consists of the firms listed below. One firm has asked not to be named at this point in time.
Tests will be conducted on a short-term and small-scale basis and the FCA has worked with the sandbox firms to agree testing parameters and build in robust consumer safeguards.

FCA acts to protect consumers’ pension pots,Press Releases,28/06/2018,28/06/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-acts-protect-consumers-pension-pots,"The consultation accompanies the publication of the final report of the Retirement Outcomes Review, the FCA’s in-depth look at how the pensions and retirement income sector has been working since the pension freedoms were introduced in 2015. The FCA found that, while consumers have welcomed the freedoms, some are at risk of harm. For example, the FCA estimates that some drawdown customers could receive 37% more retirement income from their pot every year by investing in a mix of assets rather than cash. Defined contribution pension pots will grow significantly in the coming years, so it’s important to put this market on a good footing and keep it under review.
The measures will help consumers at key points when they make decisions about what to do with their pension pot, as well as providing ongoing support to consumers once they have accessed their pension savings. They include improvements to the clarity and timings of communications prior to people making decisions about what to do with their pension pot, simplifying the options that people have, and the ongoing communications people receive.
Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA said:
“We know that the choices introduced by the pension freedoms have been popular with many consumers. However, they’re now required to make more complicated decisions than ever before. Many people need more support when making choices. The measures we have outlined today will help them think about that earlier, create investment pathways to help them with their choices and make costs and charges easier to understand.
“This is an important market that is still relatively new and is continuing to evolve. This is not the end of the work we are doing and we will continue to keep the market under review as it develops.'
Talking about pension choices earlier
The FCA is proposing that ‘wake-up’ packs should be sent to customers from the age of 50 and then every five years until the customer has fully accessed their pension pot. The new ‘wake-up’ packs will have to include a single page summary, sometimes called a ‘pensions passport’ and firms will also have to include specific retirement risk warnings at the same time as the new packs.
The new communications will be designed to address this lack of consumer engagement and help consumers engage with the risks and choices they face and prompt them to access the support and guidance they need.
Measures designed to help consumers when they access their pot
The FCA is inviting views on the introduction of investment pathways for customers at the point of entering drawdown. The FCA believes that a more structured set of options would help consumers to engage with the decisions they are making, consider what their retirement objectives are and ultimately end up with a more appropriate investment solution. The FCA also believes that firms should ensure that consumers make an active choice to be invested in cash.
In its report, the FCA found that 60% of consumers not taking advice about drawdown were not sure or only had a broad idea of where their money was invested. A third of consumers were wholly invested in cash with around half of these likely to be losing out on income in retirement.
The FCA wants drawdown options to be good value for money. To help consumers compare costs and drive good value for money, the FCA is proposing that firms include a one-year charge figure in pounds and pence in the key features illustration they provide to consumers. The FCA found that charges vary considerably from 0.4% to 1.6% between providers and can often be complex, opaque and hard to compare. If firms fail to introduce investment pathways with appropriate charge levels, the FCA has not ruled out introducing a cap on drawdown charges.
Measures designed to help consumers after accessing their pot
The FCA is proposing that all consumers who have accessed their pension should receive information from their provider annually, whether or not they are currently drawing an income from their pot. The FCA also believes that this information should include the actual charges paid in pounds and pence. The FCA found that currently some consumers do not receive annual information and for many who do, information on investment returns and annual charges is not given.
Next Steps
For some of these measures the FCA is consulting on proposed new rules. Other interventions, such as investment pathways, require further work to get the detail of implementation right across the full range of businesses affected. The FCA is therefore seeking views on this before finalising the approach.

The FCA’s role in preparing for Brexit,Statements,27/06/2018,21/09/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-role-preparing-for-brexit,"Summary
We continue to prepare for a range of scenarios, including one in which the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 without a withdrawal agreement and implementation period having been ratified between the UK Government and the EU.
The EU (Withdrawal) Act will transfer and convert existing EU law at the point of exit into UK law. It also gives powers to ministers to make secondary legislation to amend this legislation to ensure it functions effectively when the UK leaves the EU.
As part of this, the Treasury intends to task us with amending and maintaining EU binding technical standards (detailed EU rules). These rules sit underneath EU regulations and directives and provide technical detail of how those requirements must be met.
We will also be amending our Handbook to ensure it is consistent with changes the Government is making to EU law and it functions effectively when the UK leaves the EU. In the run up to March 2019, we will limit Handbook changes unrelated to Brexit to those identified as core priorities in our Business Plan as well as other essential items.
We plan to consult on these changes in the Autumn, subject to the Treasury’s timelines for Statutory Instruments (SIs). We also plan to consult on the rules which will apply to firms in the temporary permissions regime.
Government negotiations
In March, the UK and the EU reached agreement on the terms of an implementation (or transitional) period following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
The implementation period is intended to operate from 29 March 2019 until the end of December 2020. During this time, EU law would remain applicable in the United Kingdom, in accordance with the overall withdrawal agreement. Firms, funds and trading venues would continue to benefit from passporting between the UK and EEA as they do today. Obligations derived from EU law would continue to apply and firms must continue with implementation plans for EU legislation that is still to come into effect before the end of December 2020.
However, the implementation period forms part of the withdrawal agreement, which is subject to further negotiations between the UK and EU before it is finalised. We therefore continue to work to ensure the UK’s legal and regulatory framework functions in all scenarios.
The EU (Withdrawal) Act
The EU (Withdrawal) Act will repeal the European Communities Act 1972, preserve existing UK laws which implement EU obligations and convert existing EU law at the point of exit into UK law. The Act gives powers to ministers to make secondary legislation to amend this legislation to ensure it functions effectively when the UK leaves the EU.
As part of this process, the Government will need to lay SIs in Parliament. We expect this to start later in the year. In parallel, the FCA will make amendments to its Handbook and to onshored binding technical standards.
Our approach to the legal changes
The Treasury has set out that its approach to onshoring the EU acquis will not rely on any new, specific arrangements being in place between the UK and the EU after exit and that, as a general principle, EU member states will be treated as third (non-EU) countries – although there are instances where the Treasury would deviate from this general approach, including to provide for a smooth transition. We are taking the same approach. This will ensure that the requirements we are responsible for are consistent with the wider legislative framework. In certain cases we may deviate from this general approach where this is necessary to ensure a smooth transition to a new regime, or to otherwise support our strategic and operational objectives.
EU binding technical standards
The Treasury has outlined its intention to give us, the PRA, the Bank of England and the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) responsibility for amending and maintaining existing onshored EU binding technical standards so that they can operate after Brexit.
Binding technical standards are EU legislation but they do not set overall policy direction. They sit underneath ‘level 1’ EU legislation and provide technical detail on the overall legislative requirements.
The FCA Handbook
Our Handbook implements or refers to EU legislation and will need to be amended. We will not be making broader policy changes to our Handbook unless necessary. The changes are limited to amendments to ensure that the Handbook remains functional after Brexit and reflects any legislative changes made by the Government.
Consultation
We intend to consult on how we propose to amend binding technical standards and the Handbook in the Autumn, subject to the Treasury’s SI timelines. The nature of the consultation may depend on the overall progress of legislative preparations for EU withdrawal.
Some of the binding technical standards are the responsibility of more than one regulator. Where this is the case, we will work together to ensure stakeholders are clear on the changes and to whom they should send comments. We will co-ordinate with other regulators to ensure that the changes we propose are consistent and, to the extent possible, allow stakeholders to review changes concurrently.
Our priorities
Given the scale of the Handbook changes needed for Brexit, our rule making outside that context will focus on our core priorities as set out in our Business Plan. This will help us to ensure that our Handbook functions effectively on exit day and will enable stakeholders to absorb and adapt to changes to the Handbook as a result of Brexit.
We will continue to progress important initiatives, such as our High-Cost Credit Review, the implementation of the Senior Managers and Certification Regime and next steps from our Asset Management Market Study. We will delay our rule making for some initiatives, such as our work on illiquid assets or the remit of Independent Governance Committees.
Temporary permissions and new regulatory responsibilities
In December 2017, the Government announced its intention to introduce a temporary permissions regime, if necessary, which would allow EEA firms to continue operating in the UK for a time-limited period after the UK has left the EU, if no deal was reached with the EU. For those firms wishing to maintain their UK business on a permanent basis, the regime would provide sufficient time to apply for full authorisation from UK regulators. Firms and funds that are regulated in the UK solely by us will need to notify us before Brexit of their desire to benefit from the regime. This notification will not require the submission of an application for authorisation. We published a survey for inbound firms in March 2018. The aim of the survey is to help us identify firms and funds for which a temporary permission may be relevant and to inform the design of the regime.
We will consult on the rules which will apply to firms in the temporary permission regime in due course.
There are also EU entities that currently access or do business in the UK through means other than an EU passport. We will set out separate details for those entities and activities in due course.
What does this mean for you?
The Treasury has announced that it will bring forward measures that will allow for some flexibility in applying new requirements under the EU (Withdrawal) Act. We will also be prepared to introduce transitional measures. This means we do not expect firms and other regulated entities providing services within the UK’s regulatory remit to have to prepare now to implement these new requirements. Firms and other regulated entities should look at our consultations and respond accordingly.
The Bank of England has also set out details of its approach.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

FCA publishes update on wide-ranging review of retail banking sector,Press Releases,27/06/2018,27/06/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-publishes-update-wide-ranging-review-retail-banking-sector,"The Review is an in-depth and wide-ranging piece of work to give the FCA a greater understanding of retail banks’ business models, and how these may change in the future. This includes looking at how personal current accounts (PCAs) are paid for, the possible impact of technological and regulatory developments such as Open Banking and changes to payment services due to the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2).  It sets out the progress made on the analysis of the issues and planned next steps.
The review is also critical to the FCA’s work on overdrafts.  The FCA has already expressed concerns that some potentially vulnerable people are paying significantly more for their current accounts through unarranged overdraft charges and fees. In May this year, the FCA proposed a set of potential changes on overdrafts for discussion as part of its high cost credit work and will consult on any changes later this year.
The review shows that most current account customers contribute to their bank’s profits, but a small proportion pay significantly more than others – around 10% of customers generate between a third and a half of all contributions to profits from current accounts.  The data also show that many consumers go to their current bank rather than shopping around when looking for other financial products.
For example:
52% of PCA customers with credit cards have one with their PCA provider;
48% of PCA customers with personal loans have one with their PCA provider; and
32% of PCA customers with mortgages have one with their PCA provider.
Andrew Bailey, FCA Chief Executive, said: “This is an important piece of work to help us understand the complexities of the retail banking market and how this may develop in the future.
“It provides more evidence that there is no such thing as free banking. In particular, this evidence will inform the work we are doing on overdrafts, so we can fully understand the potential effects of the significant action we are considering taking in this market.'
The FCA’s analysis shows some of the reasons why retail banking markets remain highly concentrated.  Major banks have a captive audience of customers who do not switch and can be cross-sold other products.  Together they have a large share of the PCA market, currently over 80%, giving them considerable competitive advantages. 
Today’s update also sets out a number of factors that could lead to significant changes in this overall picture of the market.  In the next stage of the Review, we will look at a number of scenarios to assess when and how these changes may have an effect – including changing customer behaviour, regulatory initiatives, technological developments like Open Banking, and changes to banks’ business models such as branch closure programmes.
The FCA has collected information from 45 firms across the range of the market to inform the Review including major banks, small retail banks, building societies, specialist lenders and new digital banks.
The FCA is asking for responses to this update, including evidence or views, by 7 September 2018. The next stage of the Review will look at a range of possible future scenarios, including what branch closure programmes mean for consumers and banks’ business models, and how technological and regulatory changes may affect the market.

Information for customers of Beaufort Securities Limited (BSL) and Beaufort Asset Clearing Services Limited (BACSL),News stories,29/05/2018,03/10/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/information-customers-beaufort-securities-limited-bsl-and-beaufort-asset-clearing-services-limited,"When will I get my client money and custody assets?
The administrators are using a Distribution Plan to set out how they are returning client assets to customers. This is a plan which has now been approved by the Beaufort creditors’ committee and the Court.
Under the Distribution Plan most custody assets will be transferred to a nominated broker. On 24 September 2018 the administrators transferred the first tranche of the custody assets along with client money to one of the two nominated brokers in the Special Administration. Any remaining custody assets and client money not transferred in the first tranche and that are eligible for transfer will be moved to the two nominated brokers in later tranches. You can obtain further information on the Distribution Plan from the administrators’ website.????? Clients should contact the administrators directly if they have any questions on the Distribution Plan.
A small number of clients have disputed their statement of client asset holdings. The administrators are working on resolving these disputes with the relevant clients, and once these disputes are resolved those clients’ assets will be available to be returned.
Will I get all my client money and custody assets back?
The administrators have confirmed that nearly all the assets and money which BACSL should have been holding for clients are under the control of the administrators, and for the vast majority of clients the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) will cover any shortfalls of client money or custody assets and all the costs of distribution. There is a small number of retail clients (fewer than 10) for whom the costs of distribution and any shortfalls will be over the FSCS limit of £50,000, and those clients will have to pay any costs over this limit.
Those clients who are not eligible for FSCS compensation – or have specifically requested not to receive FSCS compensation – will need to pay the costs of distribution of the client money and custody assets, and if there are any shortfalls will not receive back all their client money and assets. There are various options for these clients to pay the costs of distribution of custody assets which are set out in the Distribution Plan. 
Do I need to use a claims management company?
We are aware that some claims management companies (CMCs) have been approaching clients of BSL and BACSL, offering to help in the recovery of assets. You should proceed with caution if you are approached by one of these companies.
For the vast majority of Beaufort’s clients, there is no benefit in involving a third party in reclaiming your assets. As set out above, the administrators have produced a Distribution Plan, under which most client money and custody assets will be transferring to a new broker, and in most cases you should get back all your client money and custody assets, with the FSCS covering the costs incurred.
If you use a CMC to assist in the return of your assets, the CMC is likely to seek a fee which may actually reduce what you get back.
If you are considering using a CMC to assist with the return of your assets, we suggest that before you decide to proceed with this route you first discuss this with the administrators using the contact details provided on their website.
Will I have to pay for my assets to be returned?
The administrators have agreed with the creditors’ committee and the FSCS a cost allocation that will see the FSCS covering 94% of the costs for returning assets to approximately 17,500 retail and corporate clients.
The cost for the return of custody assets is a flat fee, where maximum costs will be capped at £10,000 per client account and will not exceed the value of the custody assets in each client account. The costs of returning client money will be a percentage of each client money balance, which will not be more than 10%. The FSCS will cover these costs of returning custody assets and client money for all clients except those who are not eligible (ie some of the corporate clients), or those who have specifically refused to accept FSCS compensation. 
Fewer than 10 retail clients will need to pay any costs at all. Most of the remaining 6% of costs will be borne by corporate clients.
What do the costs of administration cover?
The estimated costs cover more than the administrators’ fees, with the figure being made up of operational costs (retained employees, various third party suppliers to the special administrators, such as IT service providers, telephony providers, electricity providers, landlords and others), PwC fees, lawyers’ fees, Reserves and VAT (at 20%). PwC have revised the duration of the administration to two years and accordingly revised down the administration costs to £55 million. PwC have confirmed that if the duration of the administration is shorter, then the costs incurred will be lower. The legislation, in particular Rule 135 of The Investment Bank Special Administration Rules 2011, provides for the costs of distributions of client assets to be paid for out of the assets themselves.
All costs incurred by the administrators will be subject to approval as set out in insolvency legislation and ultimately are subject to jurisdiction of the Court. PwC fees will be subject to detailed scrutiny by the creditors committee and are ultimately subject to Court approval.
As noted above, the FSCS will cover these costs of returning custody assets and client money for all clients except those who are not eligible (ie some of the corporate clients), or those who have specifically refused to accept FSCS compensation.
What is the FSCS and will they cover any other losses?
The FSCS protects consumers when financial services firms fail. It is the compensation scheme for customers of UK authorised financial services firms. It has eligibility criteria both in respect of the people and businesses who are covered. 
The FSCS will cover custody assets and client money shortfalls, including the costs associated with their distribution back to clients, for eligible clients up to £50,000.
Some clients may have suffered losses caused by BSL because of mis-selling, in which case they may bring a separate FSCS claim if they are eligible for compensation. If any clients have a Financial Ombudsman Service award in respect of BSL mis-selling then they can make a separate claim of up to £50,000 from the FSCS (ie this is in addition to any claim for recovering the costs associated with the return of their custody assets and client money from BACSL).
You can obtain further information about the FSCS on it's website.
Why the change in value of custody assets?
The administrators obtained an independent valuation of the custody assets which provisionally valued the portfolios at around £500 million. An independent valuation was needed because of various different valuations being produced following the administrators’ appointment.
Is the FCA overseeing the administration?
The firms are still authorised by the FCA and they remain subject to supervisory oversight and the FCA’s rules. In relation to BACSL, the administrators have been appointed by the Court as Special Administrators, in relation to BSL, as administrators. They are officers of the Court and need to comply with all insolvency law. The individuals appointed are also licensed insolvency practitioners and supervised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales (ICAEW). We are continuing to liaise closely with the administrators.
Why did the FCA appoint an administrator?
The FCA had concerns about BSL’s discretionary fund management business and BACSL’s client money and assets systems and governance. We placed requirements on the firms in October 2016, December 2016 and September 2017 to manage and mitigate risks of their activities. We continued to supervise the firms throughout the period, and in February 2018 we concluded that the firms were insolvent. On 1 March 2018, we applied to the Court to place both firms into insolvency proceedings. Following an emergency hearing, the Court placed both firms into insolvency; appointing three insolvency practitioners from PwC as administrators of BSL and special administrators of BACSL. We also imposed requirements on the firms, with immediate effect, which stopped the firms from conducting any regulated activities and stopping them from disposing of any firm or client assets without our consent. At the same time the US Department of Justice took action against BSL and various other parties.
How did the FCA appoint the administrators from PwC?
The FCA had detailed discussions with three different restructuring firms who had experience of insolvency of this nature and complexity, were able to undertake the work on short notice and had the resources and expertise to deal with large holdings of client assets. Following a review by FCA senior management, qualified insolvency practitioners from PwC were conflict checked and consented to act in the insolvencies.
In accordance with the Investment Bank Special Administration Regulations 2011, the appointment of the special administrator is by Court Order. In this case, this was following an application by the FCA which had been approved by the Regulatory Decisions Committee (RDC). The RDC is an FCA Board Committee that is operationally separate from the rest of the FCA and for these purposes was the final stage of decision making of the FCA.
Is it possible to hold shares ‘directly’ rather than in a nominee account?
The use of nominees allows a firm to hold clients’ assets in such a way that they are ring-fenced from the firm’s own assets, and firms are required to maintain appropriate books and records to clearly identify which assets are held for which client. There are a number of advantages both to firms and clients from holding custody assets in this way, including reduced costs to clients.
If a client wishes to hold shares directly then they can do this either by holding paper share certificates or using a sponsored CREST account. However, it is not possible to hold shares in these ways in an Individual Savings Account (ISA) or self-invested personal pension (SIPP). Exercising voting and other rights is also set out as a specific requirement for assets held within ISAs.
What are the implications of holding client assets in a nominee account?
If clients hold shares through a nominee, they do not appear directly on the shareholder register, but they are still able to exercise voting and other rights, depending on the contractual arrangements with their custodian. Under the Investment Bank Special Administration Regulations 2011, administrators are able to deduct costs of distribution from all client assets a firm holds on behalf of clients, whether the assets are held in the name of the client or in the name of a nominee.
What should I do if I have been approached by third parties claiming to be from PwC or The Share Centre and requesting to be paid a transfer fee?
The administrators have identified clients of Beaufort being approached by individuals, claiming to be representatives of PwC or The Share Centre Limited (“TSC'), requesting money is transferred to them in order to have their holdings moved to the nominated broker. 
These individuals are not acting on behalf of the administrators or either of the proposed nominated brokers and you should disregard any requests of this nature.
You are advised to contact PwC via the official channels if you are approached, or require further guidance.
What happens next?
Now that the Distribution Plan has been approved, the administrators have commenced the return of custody assets and client money, with the first transfer tranche transferred on 24 September 2018. Further transfers will follow. For further details please see the administrators’ website.
Where can I get more information?

Technology and global ties: turning the tide on financial crime,Speeches,24/05/2018,24/05/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/technology-and-global-ties-turning-tide-financial-crime,"Speaker: Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy and CompetitionLocation: Anti-Money Laundering TechSprint, LondonDelivered on: 24 May 2018
Highlights:
The financial system is the gateway through which criminals must pass to make crime pay.
New technologies have huge potential to monitor, analyse and prevent financial crime.
A clean, competitive financial system cannot be achieved in isolation – only by working together can we make a real impact.
Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version.
The past few days have seen technical experts apply their talents to the task of developing prototype solutions to combat money laundering and financial crime.
Our focus today is to bring together industry figures, technology specialists and global regulators to discuss how we can take this forward, working together to tackle some of the biggest, and most egregious, issues facing the financial sector.
This is the fifth TechSprint we’ve held, with others looking at topics as diverse as mental health, regulatory reporting and access to financial services. The scale of the issue we’re tackling today makes this TechSprint perhaps our most ambitious yet, with 400 of you here from around 100 organisations. But no one would deny that it’s a challenge worthy of our attention.
I don’t need to tell the people in this room that financial crime is big business, and a huge burden on firms, who are on the frontline in the fight to keep markets clean. 
As my colleague Megan Butler said in her speech earlier in the week, trade bodies estimate British banks spend £5bn annually combating financial crime – that's £1bn more than Britain spends on prisons.
The FCA’s own financial crime survey, in which firms submitted a year’s worth of data, showed that employees at all levels raised over 920,000 internal suspicious activity reports to their money laundering reporting officers. Meanwhile, more than 1.1m prospective customers were refused services amid financial crime concerns.
This isn’t just a compliance issue, it’s a human one.
But this isn’t just a compliance issue, it’s a human one.
It is estimated that $150bn is made from forced labour every year, that’s over $4,750 a second.
The drug trade, and the professional brutality that sustains it, is valued at $320bn annually.
And the National Crime Agency estimates up to £90 billion is laundered in the UK alone.
Whether it’s funnelling the proceeds of their trade, stealing victims’ identities to open bank accounts or funding atrocities committed on our streets, the financial system is the gateway through which criminals must pass to make crime pay.
Those links to our financial system are both a strength and a weakness. Our challenge, and the reason we’re here today, is to monitor entry, devise controls and erect barriers powerful enough to stop bad actors in their tracks.
The task is daunting. New technologies have given criminals sophisticated tools to bend the financial system to their own ends, the anonymity granted by virtual currencies being one well-known example.
But these same technologies, when used for good, could also be game changers in the fight against financial crime. 
Machine learning to improve the detection of suspicious activity, Artificial intelligence driven anti-impersonation checks and distributed ledger technology to improve the traceability of transactions are just some of the real, practicable solutions technology has gifted us.
These benefits of such advances are obvious. Not only in reducing the social cost of financial crime but in reducing the burden on firms of detecting it. 
From Australia to America, Singapore to Spain, financial crime stretches like a chain around the globe, blighting the lives of ordinary people as it goes. 
A network to beat a network
It is only by working together, pooling our resources and sharing our expertise, that we will achieve the real and tangible change we’re all seeking.
The truth is that without a harmonised approach, there can be no control.
If we’re truly going to cut the Gordian knot that is financial crime, we – both regulators and industry – have to collaborate.
If we’re truly going to cut the Gordian knot that is financial crime, we – both regulators and industry – have to collaborate. 
The potential when we collaborate is enormous.
Earlier this year we fired the starting gun on the world’s first global sandbox. This will allow firms to test innovative products and services across different jurisdictions, facilitating their ability to operate internationally. It will also allow international regulators to jointly identify and solve common cross-border regulatory problems.
This continues a tradition of collaboration that has long formed a key tenet of the FCA’s work.
In the last few years alone, we have signed 10 co-operation agreements with 8 different jurisdictions. These agreements allow us to efficiently share market trends, work closely on projects, and drive cross border business in a sensible and measured way.
The global sandbox takes this one step further – offering us a powerful, practical way of improving outcomes for consumers by making it easier for firms large and small to get new products to market.
The global sandbox could also be the vehicle that helps develop the tools and technology we need to take on financial crime.  
In fact, our hope is that some of the solutions developed over the past few days will be candidates for the global sandbox, facilitating their development and active application in the marketplace.
Conclusion 
Financial crime, the perpetrators behind it and the victims of it can be found all around the world.
Which is why it will take a network to defeat this network.
In the fight against financial crime, fragmentation is our greatest enemy. 
In the fight against financial crime, fragmentation is our greatest enemy. 
The software developers, data scientists and infrastructure engineers who have been working on prototype solutions this week, alongside the plethora of international partners who will share their observations and insights today, are testament to the collective will we have to stem the tide of financial crime. 
That is why we hope that this TechSprint will start a chain reaction of other similar events held by partners across the globe. Meanwhile, Level39, London’s largest technology accelerator, will support each of the winning teams who’ve participated this week, to help their concepts become concrete solutions. My colleague, Mark Steward, will also chair a meeting of global regulators and law enforcement officials tomorrow to reflect on what we learn today.
I spoke earlier about money laundering being the way that makes crime pay.
Through our joint efforts today, and our ongoing collaboration from tomorrow, I believe we can begin to make financial crime a poor man’s game.
And in doing so protect innumerable people in the process.
Thank you all for being here. Enjoy your day. Let’s make it count.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Building Societies and the Future of Retail Banking,Speeches,23/05/2018,24/05/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/building-societies-and-future-retail-banking,"Speaker: Jonathan Davidson, Director of Supervision - Retail and AuthorisationsLocation: Building societies annual conference 2018, ManchesterDelivered on: 23 May 2018
Note: This is the text of the speech as drafted, which may differ from the delivered version.
Key points
In the ever-evolving financial landscape, building societies have an opportunity to provide a valuable service for consumers. They can offer unique and complex products, but must also consider the unique and complex risks that come along with them. 
Mortgages are long-term products and considering affordability and lending risk is key.
Building societies should focus on healthy competition for the benefit of the consumer and the society, rather than unhealthy competition such as loosening underwriting standards or chasing significant differentials in front to back book pricing.
Today, I would like to talk about opportunities for the building society sector in light of wider developments in the market. The sector occupies a central place in the everyday life of consumers up and down the country. And this is a sector bearing witness to fundamental changes being wrought in the marketplace.
For both us as the regulator and you as industry, these changes – some social, some regulatory and some technological – are reshaping the landscape in which we operate, and challenging us both to think creatively and comprehensively about the opportunities we now face.
My main message to you here today, is that although change brings risk, it also brings opportunity. As a regulator, we want to work with you collaboratively in taking advantage of the opportunities for you to help finance a well-functioning mortgage market, provide innovative products, and help consumers to get good value for money.
Mortgage market
Benjamin Disraeli once said: ‘Change is inevitable in a progressive country. Change is constant.’ The UK has certainly lived up to this description in recent years – particularly in the housing market.
This is the market that Prime Minister Theresa May described just over a year ago as ‘broken’, with demand outstripping supply and housing becoming less and less affordable for young families. But it hasn’t always been this way. How did we get here and what does it mean for the building society sector?
To set the scene, I am going to talk about 3 eras that I have seen in the development of the UK mortgage market. The first is what I call the ‘homeownership era’. In this long period up to the early 2000s, home ownership was on the rise, driven in part by the government’s ‘Right to Buy’ policy. Home ownership rose for decade after decade eventually reaching a peak of over 70% in 2002.
Property wealth is becoming increasingly concentrated and less and less people are reaping the returns of property investment.
Then, in the run up to the financial crisis, came the ‘boom’ era, with strong growth in house prices, and correspondingly strong growth in the volume and value of mortgages. However, a significant proportion of this growth came through re-mortgaging and the withdrawal of equity. In the run up to the crisis, around 60% of new lending was re-mortgaging, and up to 12% of this new lending funded consumption. So, when the country went into recession, consumers were leveraged to the hilt.
After this, came what I call the ‘investment era’. The lucky ones even made money from their homes as house prices continued to rise – at least in some parts of the UK. A startling statistic is that in some areas the average home owner has been earning more from the growth in their home’s value than from their work. Last year’s government white paper pointed out that: ‘In 2015, the average home in the South East of England increased in value by £29,000, while the average annual pay in the region was just £24,542. The average London home made its owner more than £22 an hour during the working week in 2015 – considerably more than the average Londoner’s hourly rate.’
Who are these investors? The underlying trend is that property wealth is increasingly in the hands of baby boomers. Indeed, half of property wealth is in the hands of baby boomers.
Property wealth is becoming increasingly concentrated and less and less people are reaping the returns of property investment. For example, since the turn of the century, the rate of households owning a second home has increased 30%; the rate of private renting has doubled; and the overall rate of home ownership has fallen 7%.
By way of contrast, post-recession, young people were struggling to buy their first home, as the price of homes were, and remain, beyond the reach of many as a result of high property prices relative to income. And deposits were particularly hard to save for those facing rental costs. We also heard allegations that first time buyers were losing out as investors snapped up properties for buy-to-let. Strong growth in buy-to-let volumes stood out against a background of slow overall volume growth and value growth just keeping pace with house price growth.
All this led to government initiatives such as Help to Buy and other measures to cool the buy-to-let market. Now we have entered what I will refer to as an ‘era of diverse needs’.
Home ownership is increasingly in the hands of an ageing population. Many of the baby boomer generation will want to realise property value gains. This may come about through selling and downsizing. But also by borrowing against their equity. Some will want to release equity to help family members, what we might call ‘intergenerational wealth transfer’. Some may want to supplement retirement income. Some to fund home improvements or other purchases. Some may want to repay other debts.
Furthermore, as we go forward we are likely to see more people, who entered home ownership later, borrowing over longer terms due to high property prices and the need to make their mortgage payments affordable, carrying their mortgages into retirement.
These needs explain why the fastest growing area of lending that we see is lending to borrowers who will be beyond ‘retirement’ at maturity. In fact, lending to those who will be 76 or older at maturity is growing at 44% per annum, albeit from a low base. And lifetime mortgage lending is also on the rise.
The trends that we’re seeing create an opportunity for lenders, opportunities that building societies have been quick to snap up. As the regulator, we‘re keen to create the climate for you to provide responsible innovative products. Hence why we introduced new rules allowing for retirement interest only mortgages where the source of repayment can be sale on death or movement into long term care. The focus, however, is on ‘responsible’.
History tells us that competitive innovation that involves lenders loosening their criteria does not end well. The basic fact is this: when lending goes wrong, consumers suffer as well as firms.
Retirement interest-only is not an entirely new form of lending, but nevertheless it presents many challenges. For example, there is a natural caution to lend to older borrowers, not least due to potential challenges of assessing affordability, not to mention the potential challenge down the line by relatives as a person moves into care or passes away. But there is a real opportunity here to devise solutions that will really help and provide value to your members if done right.
But the older borrower demographic is only part of the story. The government is focused on building more homes, and schemes for first time buyers remain a priority. Younger borrowers face some significant challenges. The price of housing as measured by price to income is nearly at an all-time high. And this is a generation with little savings and high levels of other debt. Our Financial Lives survey showed that 23% of 25-34 year olds are over-indebted and about a fifth have no cash savings.
Not only are the millennials facing into an expensive housing market and financial challenges, they are witnessing big changes in the pattern of employment. While employment is at an all-time high, the number of self-employed people in the UK rose by 45% since the turn of the century; that is more than 1.5 million becoming self-employed. On top of that there are more than 900 thousand people currently on zero-hours contracts. The gig economy is growing strongly.
With all of this change, with new needs emerging and new challenges there are plenty of opportunities for building societies to help consumers.
But before I go into thoughts about these opportunities for you, I want to talk about competition.
A consumer’s perspective on competition
In addition to all this market change, as regulators we have also seen opportunity; opportunity to make the mortgage market work better for consumers both by protecting them from harm and encouraging healthy competition.
Historically, as we have approached the peak of the markets and when growth in the market has stalled, we have seen many market participants compete by loosening underwriting standards. History tells us that competitive innovation that involves lenders loosening their criteria does not end well. The basic fact is this: when lending goes wrong, consumers suffer as well as firms. So this is an area we will continue to monitor, as will our colleagues at the Bank.
Following the 2008 financial crisis, the Mortgage Market Review (MMR) and Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD) primarily focused on ensuring that consumers got good advice and didn’t end up with unaffordable mortgages. Yet we are still dealing with risks from the last boom and bust 10 years ago. Nearly 1 in 5 existing mortgages are on an interest-only basis. That’s 1.67 million interest-only mortgages outstanding in the UK, many of them made before 2008. Many present the risk of shortfalls in repayment plans, and could ultimately lead to people losing their homes.
We are dealing today with risks from lending that took place more than 10 years ago and we will still be dealing with them in 10 or 15 years. So it makes sense to ask how is the industry doing with its lending today?
There are several peaks in the maturity of interest-only mortgages. The first peak, which we’re seeing now, is likely to have fewer and more modest shortfalls as customers tend to be those approaching retirement with higher incomes, assets and levels of forecast equity in their property at the end of term.
However, the next two peaks, in 2027/2028 and 2032, include less affluent individuals who had higher income multiples at the point of application, greater rates of mortgages converted from repayment to interest-only and lower forecast equity levels. We are concerned that these customers are more at risk of shortfalls.
Our main objectives have been to encourage borrowers and lenders to take early action. Yet, we know that many customers remain reluctant to contact their lender to discuss their interest-only mortgage for a variety of reasons. We are very clear that people should talk to their lender as early as possible as this will give them more options when it comes to the next steps they can take. And we are encouraged to see that lenders have taken positive steps to engage with and help their interest-only customers.
While we are pleased that lenders have already taken positive steps to engage with and help their interest-only customers, it’s vital that complacency doesn’t set in.
Because it’s crucial we head this issue off at the pass.
We are dealing today with risks from lending that took place more than 10 years ago and we will still be dealing with them in 10 or 15 years. So it makes sense to ask how is the industry doing with its lending today? We think that the industry is currently doing a reasonable job on affordability. Nevertheless, the Bank of England recently called out some early warning signs of relaxation of lending standards. Our own data backs this up, showing that the proportion of lending at higher loan-to-income ratios is creeping up. The risk appetite of lenders will always occupy the thoughts of regulators, and in our case we worry whether any loosening of standards will harm consumers. So this is something we will continue to monitor.
We are also monitoring arrears. Although the number of mortgage accounts in arrears is at an all-time low, the level of more serious arrears (more than 5% of the loan balance in arrears) has remained relatively stable. All good, you may think. But the current rate of repossessions as a percentage of serious arrears is also at an all-time low. We do worry about the extent of forbearance being offered in cases where the borrower has no realistic chance of getting back on track. Can it really be in their interest for their arrears balances to continue to rise, if their equity continues to shrink, for an indefinite period? This is an area we are currently looking at and we will publish our findings later this year. We are also taking the opportunity to look at how firms are dealing with the changes to the payment of support for mortgage interest from a benefit to a loan, and the treatment of borrowers who do not opt for the loan that subsequently fall into arrears.
While irresponsible lending is unacceptable, we do want to see healthy competition – for example on the cost of mortgages. The Mortgage Market Study has therefore been an interesting opportunity to see how regulation has impacted the way that the market works. While the MMR focused on affordability and the role of advice in ensuring that borrowers bought a suitable mortgage, the Mortgage Market Study focused on the role of competition and how easily borrowers could find the best value deal.
The study found that changes to our rules, following the MMR, have resulted in almost all customers receiving advice before obtaining a mortgage with a new lender.
The good news from a consumer’s point of view is that the competition in the market from a cost perspective is also generally working well, though with some specific areas for improvement. Our study found high levels of consumer engagement in the market, good competition on headline rates, and little evidence that current commercial arrangements between firms are associated with material harm to consumers.
Going forward, we want to make sure that we build on the progress that has been made in relation to advice and suitability, and work with industry in considering what more can be done in helping customers get the best deal.
How might customers be able to get even better deals? Our research showed that consumers find navigating the market difficult, with there being scope for improvement in the tools supporting customers to shop around for mortgages or in helping them find the right broker. While there appears to be good competition on headline price, it is hard for consumers to get a sense at an early stage of which products they would qualify for.
This is especially the case for potential borrowers who do not have standard needs, for example, first time buyers, self-employed, retired or retiring borrowers. It seems to me that these borrowers represent an opportunity for
building societies that embody the values of membership and long term trust-based relationships
 know their members and the local community personally
 understand consumers as individuals rather than as archetypes in a risk-scoring model
We also need to think about the fair treatment of customers who do not or cannot switch mortgages.
While most consumers in the mortgage market are well engaged, there is a significant minority of consumers who stay on reversion rates for an extended period.
Some of these customers don’t have the option of switching. We estimate there are c.30,000 customers with firms authorised to lend who cannot change mortgages now due to changing lending criteria. We are planning to engage with industry and consumers to explore a number of possible options for helping these customers. And then there are other customers, who remain on a reversion rate for a longer period of time, who would benefit from switching to a new lower introductory rate but do not.
In summary on competition: I think there is an opportunity here for industry to do more to help customers find the best deal for them. We will be looking to explore a number of solutions with you, which could include looking at the role of technology in helping customers compare products or establish eligibility.
Remaining competitive – a building society perspective
Having talked about healthy competition in the interests of consumers; what does healthy competition look like for the building societies? We are conscious that price-based competition is intense for the building societies and there is noticeable and continuing squeezing of Net Interest Margins and reducing returns on capital.
I know that many building societies feel that competition is not a level playing field and feel that the large banks in particular enjoy unfair competitive advantages – not least in terms of lower capital requirements.
At the FCA, we have been looking carefully at the relative competitive advantages of the various business models in retail banking whether they are building societies, challenger banks, digital firms or big banks. In our work on retail banking business models, the two most important questions we have been asking are:
Why has banking been so dominated by the big banks?
How might competition change given all the tectonic change in the financial services landscape?
As an aside, I am often asked why are you doing this work given the work of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and others in this area; and what regulatory initiative are you contemplating taking on the back of it? There may be some initiatives that come out of this but there are two more important primary reasons for the work. First, is to take a perspective across the whole business-model – not just current accounts. And the second is to fast forward to potential scenarios for the competitive landscape and consider whether they would represent markets that are working well for consumers.
We aren’t quite ready to share our research and analysis, so I will share with you some of the hypotheses we have been working on. The first hypothesis is that large retail banks have enjoyed competitive advantages not just from capital requirements but from other factors. For example, we hypothesise that banks enjoy a competitive advantage on funding costs from the personal current account, associated savings accounts and back books of cash savings on relatively low rates. While this effect is muted by low interest rates and the costs of running current accounts and branch networks it likely represents a competitive advantage over the many building societies without current accounts and with flat pricing of their back books. We also hypothesise that current accounts have been the source of relatively profitable fee income from overdraft charges, foreign exchange and interchange revenues.
I think we are at one of the hinges in the history of retail financial services. It’s full of opportunities for you if you choose to push on the door of innovation and go about it in the right way.
But these competitive advantages could well reduce significantly. The branch network was once a foundation for current accounts. You can open current accounts or their equivalent with a few taps on your mobile phone now as many fintech firms have demonstrated. In the last few years, combining developments in smart phones, with advances in KYC technology, Monzo has opened over half a million current accounts as of March this year.
At the same time, Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) and Open Banking are working to open up access to transaction data on current accounts, credit cards and some savings accounts to other firms. The effects of this are potentially radical. I was talking to someone recently who had a permission to provide consumer credit unsecured loans and had recently received their Payment Services Directive (PSD) permission to access the accounts of customers. The business had 1/2m customers and access to 1m bank accounts. He set up a business model where if his customer was about to go into overdraft the app would see this via their access to the clients bank account and lend that customer money. It was a win for him to lend money profitably and a win for his customers who got to borrow at a much lower rate than on overdraft.
Digitisation potentially has important implications for big retail banks. But what might it mean for you?
In 2015, the Financial Times ran an article with the title ‘UK building societies slow to adjust to demands of digital age’. The article argued that with the rise of digital providers, eg Apple Pay, the building society sector remained reliant on decades-old paper-based systems. I was pleased to read the Building Societies Association (BSA) spotlight on some of the societies that have made progress in the intervening years, and have launched innovative products including financial education apps, new mortgage processing systems and comparison tools.
More recently, I think that there is an ever stronger sense that economies of scale in technology don’t exist. This further reduces the competitive advantage of the big banks. In fact, there may even be diseconomies of scale in legacy technology.
I think that all this change is a positive development for you and your members. I think we are at one of the hinges in the history of retail financial services. It’s full of opportunities for you if you choose to push on the door of innovation and go about it in the right way.
Getting it right
What does getting it right look like for a building society? I ask that you look to the traditional values of the building society and consider 4 requests from me as your conduct and competition regulator:
First, be careful and take a long term view on affordability and lending risk, especially if you are competing head to head with the big banks in the core of the ‘standard’ mortgage market. Mortgages last a long time and the future is always unpredictable.
Second, focus on properly understanding your members as individuals with unique and complex needs and, by the same token, unique and complex risks, especially if you are competing in non-standard areas such as the self-employed or older borrowers.
Third, focus on healthy competition which is in the interests of your members as well as your society especially if you are tempted to compete by loosening underwriting standards or chasing significant differentials in front to back book pricing.
And finally, please maintain a two-way dialogue with us – especially if you are looking to pilot innovative products. Do consider engaging with our Innovation Hub, which can provide additional support, or consider testing your product ideas through our sandbox.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the inevitable change foretold by Disraeli will continue to shape and re-shape the market place, and both regulator and industry alike must stay alive to the threats and opportunity such shifts present.
As your regulator, we want to see you flourish, we want what is best for your members and we want to have a dialogue with you.
The building society movement has a proud and long history of serving its members. I am hopeful that you will take advantage of opportunities to continue to make a difference to your members and the market going forward.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Turning technology against criminals,Speeches,22/05/2018,24/05/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/turning-technology-against-criminals,"Speaker: Megan Butler, Executive Director of Supervision - Investment, Wholesale and SpecialistsEvent: Anti-Money Laundering TechSprint, LondonDelivered: 22 May 2018Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version
Highlights:
Data and technology can help detect and disrupt criminal activity. 
Staff in UK banks and other firms are playing a frontline role in combating financial crime.
Phishing and identity theft are now cited by firms as the most widespread fraud risks they face.
The next big step is to apply intelligent technologies like AI, robotics, natural language processing and machine learning.
It’s a pleasure to join you and to welcome you to our fifth TechSprint. Let me start with a few words of appreciation. I know that many of you have given up a significant amount of time to attend this conference. A point that is particularly true for those who’ve travelled from outside the UK. So thank you all – in advance – for your contributions.
As will become clear over the next few days, the FCA is supportive of firms using technology to improve compliance. But we also recognise that there is reticence around innovation. Especially when it’s judged to add regulatory risk.
Our hope is that this event will alleviate some of those fears because technology is increasingly essential to combatting financial crime. And to remind people of just how important an issue this is, you only need to look at what has been covered in the UK press over the past few days.
The FCA itself, as you’d expect, does not tolerate facilitation of criminal activity by the financial services we regulate. Nor do we do shy away from regulatory and criminal enforcement. But in common with firms, we do have a public duty to explore all opportunities to combat crime. Money laundering and fraud included.
Regulators have used traditional supervisory tools for many years. We now need to think differently.
Regulators have used traditional supervisory tools for many years. We now need to think differently.
One way of doing that is events like this that help us turn technology against criminals. Another is to recognise the value of data. My plan this morning is to look at both points. But let me start with data because it is integral to understanding the nature of challenge we deal with.
Data on UK financial crime
The problem policy makers face is essentially this: criminals don’t advertise their success and the nature of money laundering, in particular, makes it extremely hard to measure, resulting in an intelligence gap. To help address this issue, the FCA launched an annual financial crime data return at the end of 2016. Sending it to several thousand UK-based firms, including all the major banks and life insurers.  
The responses gave us a number of different insights. But a general theme is that staff in UK financial services are playing a frontline role in combating crime. According to the returns, employees at all levels raised more than 920,000 internal suspicious activity reports to their money laundering reporting officers.
Firms also sent 2,117 terrorism related reports to the National Crime Agency. And a total of 13,000 restraint orders were in place to freeze customer accounts, of which 3,600 had been made during the previous year. In addition, more than 1.1m prospective customers were refused services amid financial crime concerns. And a further 370,000 existing customer relationships were exited for the same reason.
Some caveats are in order. Smaller firms were not required to respond, so the figures do not cover all businesses the FCA supervises. Also, many international business in the UK are structured so their overseas operations are regulated abroad – meaning they do not feature.
That said, around 2,100 firms responded to the survey up to the 31st December, 2017.  Meaning we can read the responses as representing a strong collective view, with each firm submitting a year’s worth of data. We expect to publish more details around these results later. But there are two points to make now.
First, it is important to recognise just how much of the direct threat to customers from financial crime has moved online. Phishing and identity theft were cited by firms as the most widespread fraud risks they now face.
The most rapidly increasing threats – with the exception of malware attacks - were phishing or variants of it. Reflecting the fact that cybercrime now accounts for nearly 50% of all recorded crime in the UK.
The second point to make is that banks undertake a lot of activity to combat financial crime. An issue I raise because we need a balanced public debate on this topic. No-one is pretending that financial services aren’t abused by criminals. They emphatically are.
So the primary question is around efficiency. How can firms get better at detecting criminals and disrupting malignant activities like people trafficking, narcotics and fraud?
But the data suggests that most financial institutions are not complacent about the risk.
So the primary question is around efficiency. How can firms get better at detecting criminals and disrupting malignant activities like people trafficking, narcotics and fraud?
Technology improving detection
And this brings me to the topic of how regulators can make firms more comfortable about using technology to deal with financial crime. A few issues to flag. First, financial institutions are judged by the public on their ability to combat crime. Not their spend doing it.
In other words, there’s no expectation on firms to spend money just to ‘show willing’ or as a way of ‘virtue signalling’. A point that is especially important given that British banks alone spend some £5bn a year combating financial crime. One billion more than the UK spends on prisons.
Please do be aware though that the international priority is overwhelmingly on efficacy. Not overheads. Cheap technologies that aren’t tested and don’t work properly are not acceptable alternatives to old, expensive tech systems that do. And this leads me to a second important issue about what is sometimes described as a ‘zero failure’ approach among regulators.
I can only repeat the fact that we are primarily interested in outcomes and that we operate in the real world.
So if there are methods, innovations, or technologies that help you combat crime, tell regulators about them – and do not be afraid to move first. Excessive risk aversion is not going to help us win an arms race that is so heavily rooted in automation. We need to turn technology against criminals. 
Our own analysis suggests that transaction monitoring is the area with the most potential. But it is by no means the only one. Onboarding, maintenance, client screening and reporting - among other issues – are frequently cited.
At the moment, we see a lot of firms using compliance technology to automate existing processes so they keep on top of volume. Particularly reducing false positives in transaction monitoring. 

But a lot of banks still employ thousands of investigators to manually review high-risk transactions and accounts. ‘Checkers checking the checkers’ – as the saying goes.
The next big step is to apply intelligent technologies - like AI, robotics, natural language processing and machine learning - so that firms can spot suspicious transactions in real time from unstructured account and transaction data.
That is obviously not simple – for a number of reasons.
First, there are practical obstacles. A lot of large firms, for example, need to integrate legacy systems – in some cases dating back to the seventies. Others face significant clean-up exercises to address issues around fragmented, poor-quality data.
Second, there are important questions around issues including bias and transparency. Proprietary algorithms, for instance, can become black boxes. Meaning developers themselves don’t necessarily know why a machine is making the recommendations its making.
developers themselves don’t necessarily know why a machine is making the recommendations its making
In fact, last year the Financial Stability Board made a point of saying that communication mechanisms used by machine learning may be ‘incomprehensible to humans’.

So under these circumstances, what information and detail is it reasonable for regulators to request? And what leeway is there for firms if something goes wrong?
The question we get asked by financial institutions is essentially this: ‘will you let me off the hook if we introduce new tech’. The answer to that is no.
But that is not to say that new technology can’t significantly reduce your risk exposure if you implement it in a way that you would any other – involving proper testing, governance and management.

Don't be afraid to use technology
A number of organisations in this room have already started doing this extremely well. Among them colleagues at the Australian Transaction and Analysis Centre.
But your input is essential if we want these success stories to become more ubiquitous.
So by way of conclusion, please do not be afraid – wherever you are based – of working with your regulators on systems that you feel might offer genuine benefit. I am conscious that we hear messages so often about public duty that they can sometimes lose their impact.
But events like this can genuinely make an extraordinary social difference – in ways that most of us cannot even begin to comprehend.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Darren Newton banned by the FCA for misappropriating client money,Press Releases,21/05/2018,21/05/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/darren-newton-banned-fca-misappropriating-client-money,"Mr Newton is disputing the FCA’s decision and has referred the matter to the Upper Tribunal at which the FCA and Mr Newton will be able to present their cases. Accordingly, this decision notice has no effect pending the determination by the Tribunal. 
The FCA found Mr Newton used customers’ money for the purchase of the debt management firm, First Step Finance Limited. This showed a serious lack of honesty and integrity and, as a result, the FCA has decided that he is not a fit and proper person.
The FCA’s case is that Mr Newton purchased First Step, through his company, from Christine Whitehurst and, between 18 October 2013 and 28 May 2014, was the sole director of First Step and a director of another debt management company, Debt Help and Advice Limited. Mr Newton funded the purchase of First Step from the accounts of First Step, with client money, rather than his own funds. He directed or allowed £322,500 to be transferred from the First Step accounts to Mrs Whitehurst. Mrs Whitehurst and her husband, Adrian Whitehurst, were banned by the FCA in October 2017 for dishonestly misappropriating money from First Step.
Further, the FCA considers Mr Newton knew these monies from First Step should only have been used to pay customers’ creditors or to be returned to customers and they were paid to Mrs Whitehurst when First Step had a significant client money shortfall in its accounts of over £6 million.
The firm went into administration on 28 May 2014 with a client money shortfall of £7,156,036 from over 4,000 customers. 
First Step was a debt management firm offering a debt reduction service to its customers. First Step collected and held client monies before making full and final settlement offers to customers’ creditors.
After the purchase of First Step on 18 October 2013 customers were meant to be transferred to Debt Help and Advice, from that date. However, the transfer of customers did not take place. First Step continued to receive payments from existing clients until it was placed into administration in May 2014.
Notes to editors
Decision notice for Darren Lee Newton (PDF).
Press release relating to Adrian and Christine Whitehurst?.
On 1 April 2014, consumer credit regulation transferred from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to the Financial Conduct Authority. On that date firms holding a consumer credit licence issued by the OFT were, on application, automatically granted interim permission to continue trading under article 56 of the Order 2013. First Step did not have a license from OFT at the date and was not granted interim permission by the FCA.
Debt Help and Advice was granted interim permission by the FCA. The firm is now dissolved after being in administration.
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.
Consumers who need advice on managing their debts can contact the Money Advice Service, a free and impartial service set up by the government. You can contact them online or by phone on 0800 138 7777. Calls cost no more than to a standard UK-wide number.
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

EU Withdrawal
News and Publications
Introduction: Nausicaa Delfras, Executive Director of International
This is the first of what I expect will be many updates in my new role as Executive Director of International. We are working to enable a smooth transition on EU withdrawal, with reference to our statutory objectives of consumer protection, market integrity and competition. This includes ensuring there is a robust regulatory system on the day the UK leaves the EU, and that markets function well during and beyond exit day.  
To do this, we are working with firms to understand their plans for future operations and the potential impacts on their activities and customers.  
For firms and funds currently passporting into the UK, there is no need to apply for authorisation at this stage, due to the agreement on an implementation period and the Government’s commitment to providing for a Temporary Permission Regime as a backstop.
However, all firms should be considering the impact of EU withdrawal on their activities and customers, both in the event the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, and also the implications of a transitional period until December 2020, under which EU rules will continue to apply.  
As part of this, firms that undertake business in the EEA should consider the legal basis on which this occurs, including whether they need additional regulatory permissions in light of EU withdrawal and whether their customers need to be informed of any changes. They may also wish to discuss this with the relevant local regulator and/or seek legal advice, including foreign law advice. 
We know that planning for EU withdrawal will be a major focus for many firms over the coming year and we will make every effort to keep you informed and updated. For regular updates, please refer to our dedicated pages.

Interim report on the mortgage market
We published our interim report which sets out our provisional view on the way competition works in the mortgages market and how we would like the market to develop. 
Our interim report finds that competition in the mortgage market is working well for many people. However, we have also identified a number of ways in which the market could work better for some people. Our proposals are particularly aimed at helping customers find the best-priced suitable mortgage deal. The FCA also wants to help longstanding borrowers who are currently unable to switch to a better deal, often referred to as ‘mortgage prisoners’.
We are consulting on our interim findings and proposed remedies and we want to engage with a wide range of market participants. The report includes details on how you can give us your feedback. We intend to publish a final report around the end of the year and will consult on any specific changes required to our rules.

Payment Accounts Directive
As part of our work on the implementation of the Payment Accounts Directive (PAD), we have published the final UK linked services list. It explains how we have integrated the EU standardised terminology into the UK provisional list to form the UK final linked services list.
From 31 October 2018, payment service providers that offer payment accounts are required to use the terminology in their contractual, commercial and marketing information and make available a glossary of terms.
From 31 October 2018, providers will also be required to provide a pre-contractual fee information document (FID) and an annual statement of fees (SoF). Further information can be found in Delegated Regulations published by the European Commission, which can be found here: FID and SoF.
5 Conduct Questions – second feedback report
This month, we’ve published our second 5 Conduct Questions feedback report. It focuses on how banks can encourage people in front, middle and back office, and control and support functions, to be responsible for managing the conduct of their business. 
Our report summarises what we’ve been told by the firms, with examples of what worked well and what didn’t. We encourage everyone in the wholesale sector to look at the report.
The 5 Conduct Questions were introduced in 2015, as a key component of the supervision programme for Wholesale Banking. Since then, leading wholesale banking firms have invested substantial efforts in change programmes related to conduct and culture.

Financial Advisers
PS on retiring FG 12/15 and FG 14/1
On 11 May, we published PS 18/10 on retiring FG 12/15 and FG 14/1 which related to old rules on describing advice services, and inducements, respectively.
PS 18/10 provides important information for any firm which has previously used FG 12/15 or FG 14/1. 
PS 18/10 concludes the consultation process we launched (as part of PS/17/25) in December 2017 on retiring the 2 pieces of guidance. We considered that both pieces of guidance had been largely superseded by recent changes to our rules including the re-cast Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), which came into effect on 3 January 2018. 
PS 18/10 summarises feedback from the consultation. It explains that we have retired both pieces of guidance, and that we are not providing any further guidance or clarification on the new rules at this time.

Asset Management Authorisation Hub
We’re expanding the Asset Management Authorisation Hub to give additional information for the pre and post authorisation process. 
Since launching the Hub, in October 2017, we have been offering firms access to a dedicated web portal, weekly pre-application meetings, a named case officer and more support when transitioning from authorisation to supervision.  
Now we’re offering interactive flowcharts (eg to visualise the various authorisation options under AIFMD), a navigator that determines a firm’s prudential category, an online booking system for pre-application meetings and the announcement of our first event on Patient Capital in the autumn this year.  
The Hub seeks to maintain high standards for firms seeking to come into the marketplace and encourage competition. It aims to do this by reducing unnecessary regulatory barriers in establishing and running an asset management firm in the UK. Specifically it aims to: 
clarify expectations and support firms with better guidance on regulations and processes
make information easier to access
foster a more personalised engagement between the FCA and market entrants
We will roll out further phases of the Hub towards the end of this year.

EU Withdrawal
Passporting into the UK Survey
In our statement on EU withdrawal following the March European Council, we confirmed EEA firms and funds currently benefiting from an EU passport need not apply for authorisation in the UK at this stage. This followed HM Government’s continuing commitment to providing for a Temporary Permission Regime as a backstop, and the agreement on the terms of an implementation period. 
We also launched a short online survey to collect information from those EEA firms and funds who access the UK market via a passport. We encourage relevant firms to complete the survey, which should only take 15 minutes. The survey is open until the end of May. The information gathered will help inform and support our future EU withdrawal-related communications.

FCA consults on new guidance on variation terms under unfair terms legislation,Press Releases,17/05/2018,31/05/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-consults-new-guidance-variation-terms-under-unfair-terms-legislation,"Under the CRA the FCA has the power to consider the fairness and transparency of terms in consumer contracts. Where the FCA considers a variation term in a contract to be unfair or lacking in transparency, it may take action to prevent the firm from relying on that term. 
Fairness and transparency are not new requirements under the CRA. Before it came into force, firms were required to draft fair and transparent terms in consumer contracts under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 (UTCCRs) and the preceding Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994 (the 1994 Regulations). The draft guidance provides references to the relevant provisions in the UTCCRs, and sets out its application to contracts entered into under the 1994 Regulations. It is relevant to all consumer contracts issued by firms following the entry into force of the UTCCRs.   
The draft guidance outlines a number of non-exhaustive areas the FCA believes firms should have regard to when drafting and reviewing variation terms.  These include and are not limited to the following:
The validity of the reason(s) for varying a term
The transparency of the variation term
Provision for notice in the variation term
Provision for freedom to exit the contract should a consumer not wish to accept the variation
The draft guidance outlines factors for firms to consider when seeking to draft variation terms, and also considers a number of reasons that the FCA has observed firms commonly include, when drafting variation terms allowing them to alter their consumer contracts.
The FCA has published the proposed new draft guidance following the introduction of the CRA and in light of a number of rulings on variation terms in the Court of Justice of the EU. The FCA does not propose to conduct a proactive systemic review assessing the fairness of variation terms in contracts entered into prior to any eventual final guidance being issued. Our day-to-day unfair terms case work has considered variation terms from a variety of products and does not suggest that variation terms have generally been used in a manner likely to cause widespread harm to consumers. Where unfair terms come to the FCA’s attention, and it considers that firms have been relying upon such terms to the detriment of customers, the FCA will challenge firms accordingly.
Notes to editors
GC18/2: Fairness of variation terms in financial services consumer contracts under the Consumer Rights Act 2015
The Competition and Markets Authority has a lead role in relation to unfair terms law, but shares most of its consumer powers with a number of other agencies, including the FCA in relation to financial services contracts (The Competition and Markets Authority is an independent non-ministerial department, which works to promote competition for the benefit of consumers, both within and outside the UK. Its aim is to make markets work well for consumers, businesses and the economy).
In July 2015, the CMA published detailed guidance on the unfair terms aspects of the CRA which remains applicable to all firms.
The draft guidance makes clear that the FCA considers that variation terms in financial services contracts are not exempt from the fairness test, merely because they fall within an exception to the statutory list of terms which may be regarded as unfair (commonly referred to as the ‘grey list’). The grey list and the exceptions to it are set out under Parts 1 and 2 respectively of Schedule 2 to the CRA.
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

The FCA’s Business Plan and Priorities,Speeches,16/05/2018,16/05/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/fca-business-plan-and-priorities,"Speaker: Andrew Bailey, Chief ExecutiveEvent: BIBA 2018 Annual Conference & Exhibition, Manchester Central Conference CentreDelivered: 16 May 2018Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version
Highlights
The FCA has 7 cross-sector priority areas that we have identified, based on assessments of where intervention can have the greatest impact, or where there is the greatest harm or potential for harm to our objectives.
We are seeing the application of technological innovation to the business of general insurance.
We see insurers are very active in the Big Data and data-use field
It is a real pleasure to be at the British Insurance Brokers' Association (BIBA) Conference today. I want to use my time on the subject of our Business Plan for the next year, and the issues that we have picked out in the general insurance world. I want to then take one particular issue that is attracting much more attention generally, namely the subject of data and its use. I could have given this speech the sub-title ‘9 Days and Counting’. You would rightly have concluded that my counting skills had gone severely off for the royal wedding. I am not trying to match that for popular appeal when I say that it is 9 days to go until the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force.
The FCA has a broad remit. The work we do affects every household and business in the UK. This puts even more emphasis on having a Business Plan that explains how we approach our task, and where on the waterfront we will be placing a particular focus, on which issues and risks to our objectives to protect consumers, to protect the integrity of financial markets, and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.
Brexit
Quite rightly, we have to make choices on our priorities. This year those choices are more challenging because we have had to put together a plan that reflects the level of resource the FCA needs to dedicate to EU withdrawal. To be clear, I say that without any judgement on Brexit itself. Our job is to roll our sleeves up and get on with the task of effective implementation.
We are working on the basis that the UK’s exit from the EU will take place in March next year. After this, we expect a transition or implementation period to take effect, which we strongly welcome. We think that having such a period is in the interest of all parties in this process, for two reasons.
First, because we need a period of time in which there is clarity and stability about the relationship between the UK and the EU so that we can put in place remedies for the risks that could arise from a sudden change in that relationship, which we tend to call the cliff-edge risks. And second, it is surely better to have a period when we need to prepare for that future relationship knowing what it will be. I would like to think that is a consensual statement.
Let me continue for a moment on the so-called cliff-edge risks. These arise in large part if there is a sudden and disorderly falling away of the passporting system without having an effective plan to bridge to the future. The passporting system goes both ways, from the UK to the EU, and from the EU to the UK, so both sides have a strong interest in orderly transition. This is not about one side asking for a favour or picking a cherry. The risks of not getting this right are considerable, because without passporting the authorisations of those firms that rely on it fall away in the market into which they passport, unless some other action is taken. This matters because the authorisation provides the legal basis to continue to service existing contracts in many EU countries including the UK.
That may sound a bit dry, but it isn’t. In insurance, servicing a contract means the legal basis to pay on claims to policyholders and receive premiums from them. The most recent information suggests that this could affect £27 billion of insurance liabilities and 10 million UK policyholders and around £55 billion of insurance liabilities and 38 million policyholders in the rest of the European Economic Area (EEA). So, this is not a small issue.
I am now going to indulge in what could be regarded as a question from the Brexit version of Trivial Pursuit. As of this April, 5,910 financial services firms were passporting out of the UK under EU Directives, and 8,629 firms were passporting in. If I asked the question, which EU Directive, and hence which financial services activity, has the most passports each way – and here’s one clue, it's the same answer both ways – which would you guess? The answer is the Insurance Mediation Directive, in other words the insurance brokers and intermediaries passport. The numbers, by the way, were 2,775 out of the UK and 5,853 into the UK. That's just under 60% of all the passports. I have to confess that I would not have guessed that in advance of knowing. However, let me add an important caveat, particularly for the inward passports. Since they are mostly so-called services passports, involving cross-border selling with no branch presence in the UK, we don’t know how many of these passports are in active use.
Last December, the UK Government committed to legislate to allow insurance companies from the rest of the EEA to continue to service insurance policies held by UK-based customers by creating a regime of temporary permissions and did the same for other financial services. This is very welcome, and I am grateful to the Government for their commitment to provide this backstop assurance for policyholders in the UK.
However, I hope that we will see an agreement between the UK and the EU which means that this backstop is just that, and instead we have a permanent commitment to open financial markets. In the absence of that agreement to date, we need the backstop. But, and this ’but’ is very important, such a temporary permissions regime implemented in the UK cannot cover customers in the rest of the EEA with policies from a passported UK insurer. At present, such customers are reliant on their UK insurance company transferring existing contracts to legal entities located in the EU, a more complicated process. Any change or backstop arrangement here is in the gift of the EU not the UK. I very much hope that we will see progress soon to deal convincingly on both sides with these transaction risks, and I welcome the process being established by Mark Carney and Mario Draghi to assist with this work.
Can I add here that if as insurance brokers you feel uncertain about the issue of contract continuity and on what you can place reliance, and thus the implications for contractual terms, please do come and talk to us and we will do our best to assist.
The FCA Business Plan for 2018-19
I want now to move on to highlight a number of the major themes in our Business Plan for this year. It is crucial that our work on Brexit does not prevent us from fulfilling our statutory objectives — the bedrock of what we do.
I am going to describe the 7 cross-sector priority areas that we have identified, based on assessments of where intervention can have the greatest impact, or where there is the greatest harm or potential for harm to our objectives. You will immediately see that some of these priority areas are more closely related to general insurance than others, so I will make this description fairly brief. I will then go on to focus on those which do relate closely to general insurance, providing more detail on these by drawing on our latest Sector Views publication as well as the Business Plan.
It is crucial that our work on Brexit does not prevent us from fulfilling our statutory objectives — the bedrock of what we do
Let’s start then with the 7 cross-sector priorities.
Firms’ culture and governance
We will continue to support and engage with firms to ensure their purpose, leadership, governance arrangements and approach to rewarding staff do not lead to harm to customers. Key work in this area includes finalising the rules for the extension of the Senior Managers and Certification Regime to all Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) firms.
High-cost credit
We have already taken action to protect potentially vulnerable consumers by putting in place new rules for high-cost short-term credit firms, as well as taking supervisory and enforcement action against credit firms who don’t meet our standards. This year we will consolidate this work by looking at alternatives to high-cost credit, focusing on solutions designed to increase choice and availability and barriers which may stymie these efforts.
Tackling financial crime
We will do this by ensuring that firms have adequate systems and controls in place to prevent criminal activity occurring and that markets are not being used to harbour or facilitate financial crime and money laundering. 
These priorities illustrate well the size of the landscape under the FCA’s remit and the scale of the challenges we face, but also why it is, for us at least, such an exciting plan to take forward
Data security, resilience and outsourcing
Our work here focuses on ensuring that firms are more resilient to cyber-attacks and technology outages. One area we are focusing on is outsourcing arrangements, where the service provider supports many firms and so the impact of any disruption is magnified.
Innovation, Big Data, technology and competition
FinTech and Big Data are transforming financial services. We will seek to maintain a regulatory environment where consumers and firms can maximise the opportunities of competition, innovation and Big Data while ensuring consumers don’t suffer harm as a consequence of those innovations. Particularly exciting over the coming months will be our work with fellow regulators on a blueprint of the global sandbox – in which innovative firms can test in multiple jurisdiction, minimising time to market.
The treatment of existing customers
If competition is working well in a market, it should not overly disadvantage existing customers over new ones. Part of this is ensuring consumers are making informed decisions. We know, for example, that there are people who just renew their insurance automatically every year – how do we ensure they’re empowered to shop around and get a good deal?
Long-term savings, pensions and intergenerational differences
The UK population is changing, and so are its financial needs. An ageing population, increased life expectancy and greater onus on consumers to manage their financial futures present challenges and possible harms. Areas like unsuitable pension transfer advice, effective competition in non-workplace pensions and savings adequacy work will be our focus here. This year we will also deliver a package of remedies as part of the Retirement Outcomes Review.
These priorities illustrate well the size of the landscape under the FCA’s remit and the scale of the challenges we face, but also why it is, for us at least, such an exciting plan to take forward.
Specific Business Plan priorities for general insurance
I now want to move on and focus more on a couple of these priorities which are important, but not unique to general insurance, namely the treatment of existing customers and data use, security and resilience. I am going to start by briefly describing the key elements of our Sector Views as they relate to general insurance.
It almost goes without saying that general insurance is a very important sector both in its retail and wholesale forms. In many parts of the sector we see strong competition to acquire new business, which we welcome. In retail markets we have focused on switching rates as an indicator of competition and the fairness of pricing. In the personal lines market, just over a year ago we introduced rules requiring greater transparency from firms at renewal. We will be reviewing the impact of this requirement as more evidence becomes available.
We are also seeing the application of technological innovation to the business of general insurance. What lies behind quite a bit of this change is the ability of insurers to assess risk with more accuracy, thereby segmenting consumers and offering personalised products, thus prompting growth in on-demand insurance products. We expect to see further development of insurance products along these lines and likewise technological advances in the availability and analysis of data are likely to drive further innovation. This underlines the fact that insurance is by its very nature a data-hungry activity.
One of the most significant regulatory changes in 2018/19 will be the implementation of the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) which comes into force on 1 October 2018
Operational resilience is a focus across our whole landscape, and rightly there is close attention on the risks from IT outages and cyber-attacks. Unauthorised loss or disclosure of customer data has also become a more significant issue, not least as a product of a number of high profile incidents some of which have originated in the financial services sector, others not.
I now want to move on to the issues highlighted in the Business Plan in relation to general insurance before spending the remainder of my time on one specific issue, data.
One of the most significant regulatory changes in 2018/19 will be the implementation of the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) which comes into force on 1 October 2018. The IDD will help reduce conflicts of interest and ensure firms act in consumers’ best interests.
The IDD should reduce the risk that firms will sell unsuitable products to consumers. It requires firms to identify the target audience for products to ensure they are designed to meet these consumers’ needs, and regularly review these products to ensure they continue to do so.
On other Business Plan issues, I want to start with the wholesale insurance sector. There have been significant changes in the sector. Recent years have seen brokers developing new services and business practices. Given these changes, we are exploring how well competition is currently working and whether it could work better in the interests of clients.
Last year we began a market study to assess whether brokers use their bargaining power to get clients a good deal, if any conflicts of interest exist and how broker conduct affects competition. We aim to publish our interim findings from the market study by the end of this year. This report will set out our analysis and preliminary conclusions, and any potential solutions to address identified concerns.
In the retail sector, I want to start with renewal pricing, an important issue. I am grateful for the work that BIBA is doing in this area, along with the Association of British Insurers (ABI).
We are currently in the midst of some work to better understand pricing practices in retail general insurance, focussing on home insurance. As with any work since the publication of our Mission, this will consider what effect current pricing practices have on particular groups of consumers, including vulnerable consumers. We expect to report our key findings in the third quarter of this year. Once we’ve concluded this discovery work, formalising the debate, we’ll assess whether we need to act to ensure future insurance pricing practices support a market that works well for its customers.    
I am grateful for the work that BIBA is doing in this area, along with the ABI. As the guiding principles published by BIBA and the ABI last week indicate, insurance customers’ loyalty should not be penalised, and it’s essential that firms are fully implementing our rules on renewal disclosure.
Certainly our expectations could not be clearer, insurers and intermediaries need to ensure that they are treating all their customers fairly when selling or renewing cover.
The next subject to highlight involves the provision of insurance to vulnerable consumers. As noted in our Consultation Paper on Our Future Approach to Consumers, while not necessarily vulnerable, some consumers can find that they are inadvertently excluded from participating in financial services due to their specific characteristics or circumstances, or that firms actively do not wish to service them due to the perceived risk that they represent. When a consumer faces barriers accessing financial services this undermines their ability to take responsibility for their own financial security, which in turn potentially damages their longer-term wellbeing.
This summer, we will publish a Feedback Statement from our Call for Input on Access to Travel Insurance, which looked at the challenges for firms and consumers in providing and accessing fairly-priced cover for people with pre-existing medical conditions. We want to understand the market and consumers’ journeys better and use this as an opportunity for industry, regulators and consumer groups to work together to produce meaningful change for vulnerable consumers.
Our concern here is that the market for travel insurance appears to be segmented between more mainstream and specialist providers. The former may have a limited appetite to insure more serious medical conditions. Specialist providers are prepared to insure consumers with these conditions, and quite often at lower premiums based on a more in-depth risk assessment. But consumers may often be unaware of the lower premiums offered by specialist providers.
We are aware that at least 100 BIBA members advise that they can place travel insurance for specialist cancer cases. I think the issue is one of signposting, where to go to find it. But let me say thanks to BIBA for your ‘Find a Broker Service’. Our feedback indicates that it really does help, as does the agreement between BIBA, the ABI and the Government on access to insurers for older consumers. So, I think the issue is how to ensure the signposting is effective, and particularly in the area of price comparison websites (PCW). Our Financial Lives survey found that 76% of respondents use a PCW when comparing different single trip travel insurance from different providers. I know that the PCWs do not belong to BIBA, and I am not going to venture into that field save to say that I hope we can all work together to improve the signposting. And, I should add that we used travel insurance as an important case study. The principle of good signposting should apply as a general matter for insurance for all consumers.
Data
I want now to move on to the subject of data. As I mentioned earlier, Big Data is one of our priority themes. I am going to divide my remarks on data into two points: first, why the subject is important in insurance; and second, the issues we face today and the impact of the new EU data regulation.
Insurance by its very nature is a data-hungry business – the assessment and pricing of risk depends on good data on the insured. So, it should be no surprise that we see insurers are very active in the Big Data and data-use field. My starting point is that the much expanded access to and ability to process that goes with Big Data has clear positives and some risks of harm. The positives come from better assessment and pricing of risk, and also that if – as is happening – it allows insurers to price risk on a more individual basis, rather than putting us in sub-groups. This can not only improve risk assessment, but also can create a virtuous outcome where if we are individually assessed, we are incentivised to improve our habits – say our driving if it can be directly observed – and this could be a good thing. We may drive more carefully if we can count the benefit of doing so in a lower premium. This doesn’t work so well if we are in sub-groups whose average behaviour we can do little to influence.
Insurance by its very nature is a data-hungry business – the assessment and pricing of risk depends on good data on the insured
So far so good: less good is if greater access to data enables at least one of two outcomes. Suppose, hypothetically, our behaviour and the outcomes become highly predictable. That makes insurance less useful or even impractical. This may matter in areas like health insurance. We are some way away from that state of affairs I think. But suppose – as we have seen happen – more access to data allows an easier identification of those who do not observe their premium rate when renewing a policy. This could lead to unfair outcomes, particularly if the person is vulnerable and/or there is a risk of someone being financially excluded . That is a harmful and unwanted outcome.
Let me give one more example that we have also seen. Suppose the greater access to data allows more sophisticated data mining to price the risks of insured persons. But suppose that mining produces results which say that it is statistically significant that your risk will appear to depend on some observed data variable, but I can provide no plausible reason to explain that. This can be called correlation rather than causation (you can find an association between the two things but it is very hard to tell a convincing story about why it exists). A appears to lead B but I can provide no convincing reason why. I would contend that it is hard to explain to a customer that I am pricing them on this basis but I can't really explain why that should be so. I would think twice about doing this, but we have seen it happen.
I now want, finally, to move on to the broader debate on data. It's timely, with the EU GDPR coming into effect on 25th of this month. I am going to start with the GDPR.
What are the important features of GDPR? GDPR places more emphasis than before on those processing personal data being accountable for and transparent about the lawful basis for that processing; in other words, identifying the processing and explaining it to individuals. The notion of genuine consent is important here, namely that individuals have real choice and control for instance through positive opt-in rather than default mechanisms or pre-ticked boxes. Genuine consent builds trust and engagement, and thus the representation of firms. But there are other bases on which data can be processed, beyond consent which include contract requirements and legal obligations.
GDPR also places more emphasis on the rights of individuals in respect of their data. Individuals must, for example, be given more information than before about how their data are processed, be allowed access to their data and have more control about how they are used (including a new right of ‘portability’).
A number of principles underpin GDPR. Important here are responsibility and accountability and thus the role of governance in firms. Turning the principles into practice requires a more proactive approach on the obligations of controllers to and the rights of individuals. It requires contracts to be in place when using a third party data processor, but having a contract in place does not mean that the responsibility for compliance with GDPR can be outsourced. And last, but not in any way least, there is an important security principle around the protection of individuals’ data.
So, there we have the short-version of GDPR. Let me now give a second perspective on this landscape. It draws on work commissioned by the Financial Services Consumer Panel and conducted by the Management Department of the London School of Economics (LSE). I am grateful for the Panel for sponsoring this work which is a valuable input. The perspective is very much on financial data, and is much more an assessment of the world as it is using structured surveys. It is the world into which the GDPR lands if you like.
An important and positive conditioning point is that the vast increase in the processing of data can lead to more innovation and competition in financial markets and can open the markets up to consumers. That said, the risks are that such processing can exacerbate information asymmetries, create conflicts of interest among commercial parties involved and can increase the risk of some consumers being excluded.
A key finding of the LSE work is that consumers don’t understand the value of their personal data, and therefore what ownership really means.
Let me offer a few thoughts on the issue of how each of us values our data. It is unsurprising that the value is little understood since the uses of data are changing so rapidly. Second, bad shocks can undermine the credibility and hence the value attached to data processing, and we have had quite a few of those – think loss of data incidents and misuse incidents. The attitudes that get formed can be highly contextual, over time, over the types of data, and the organisations using data.
The conclusion I draw from this is that it is unsurprising that consumers find it hard to put a value on their data. We should not base our protections on assuming that they do know this value. There is, however, a subtle but important distinction between whether consumers know the value, and what they value. The LSE study suggests individuals value privacy, but it is less clear what degree of privacy they expect and assume given the pace of change. But, many really value speed of access and expect it, the need for speed if you like. The trade-off between speed and privacy may be an example of the conflict between short-term rewards and longer-term goals. But if we come back to the GDPR and the theme of consent, the need for speed tends to suggest that the process of consent is viewed as tedious once the decision has been made to go ahead. This is a challenge.
This brings me naturally to the form of consent. GDPR puts emphasis on the importance of informed consent to share and use personal data. The LSE study found that terms and conditions (T&Cs) used were ineffective at explaining the intended use of data to customers, and did not leave those who read them much wiser, and in the testing done the T&Cs mostly were not read. The GDPR definition of consent as ‘freely given, unambiguous and informed’, or put another way a genuine choice which can be revoked, does not start therefore against a promising background.
Once again, the need for speed point is relevant here. And in the LSE tests, more than half of the participants believed that the consent they had given was uninformed. It begs the important question, namely what is informed consent in a world of large-scale data processing where speed is of the essence, and how can it operate in a world where the behavioural bias is to favour short-term rewards over longer-term goals? It is therefore welcome that in its recent Consumer Green Paper the Government set out its intention to improve the clarity of on-line terms and conditions.
The major expansion of data processors has complicated the line of sight for consumers on what is being done or can be done with their personal data
The LSE study asks an important question which I will paraphrase as, if you don’t look at T and Cs, what do you rely on to make these choices? The answer is a form of what can be called the presumed wisdom of the crowd and third parties with a particular role to play, including regulators. In this, there is a high degree of social acceptance which draws on pre-existing assumptions of sources of protection. Thus, on-line reviews are an assumed source of protection, and therefore assumed to be unbiased. The regulatory environment shapes the form and scope of customer trust, and here I define regulation broadly. But it turns out that when probed, awareness of the specifics of the regulatory environment is at best very general. The risk here is immediately apparent, namely that the presumed compensating factors for the absence of scrutiny of the consent decision are not as well understood as they should be in that situation. Responsibility is therefore assumed to be transferred to a combination of suppliers and public bodies.
Conclusion
I am not going to attempt to summarise all of the FCA Business Plan in a shorter space than the description I have provided. But let me finish with a few reflections on the issue of personal data. The major expansion of data processors has complicated the line of sight for consumers on what is being done or can be done with their personal data. This major change forces judgement on issues that are hard to assess, such as how much do I value my privacy. Services that can appear to be free to consumers are typically not, but this forces to the forefront the difficult issue of what value, explicit or implicit, we put on our data. Closely following on is the issue of how a growing realisation of the value and security of our data leads to views on what is, and is not, acceptable in terms of the use of our data. This is important, because trust in the process of handling data is likely to be linked to the uses to which the data are put. The FCA is not the primary regulator in this field, that role is taken by the Information Commissioner. But our role in protecting consumers and in the integrity of markets inevitably means that we are focused on the use and misuse of personal data. ",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

"FCA and PRA jointly fine Mr James Staley £642,430 and announce special requirements regarding whistleblowing systems and controls at Barclays",Press Releases,11/05/2018,11/05/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-and-pra-jointly-fine-mr-james-staley-announce-special-requirements,"Barclays is also now subject to special requirements by which it must report annually to the regulators detailing how it handles whistleblowing, with personal attestations required from those Senior Managers responsible for the relevant systems and controls.
Mark Steward, FCA Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, said:
“Given the crucial role of the Chief Executive, the standard of due skill, care and diligence is more demanding than for other employees.
“Mr Staley breached the standard of care required and expected of a Chief Executive in a way that risked undermining confidence in Barclays’ whistleblowing procedures. Chief Executives must act with a high degree of care and prudence at all times. Whistleblowers play a vital role in exposing poor practice and misconduct in the financial services sector. It is critical that individuals are able to speak up anonymously and without fear of retaliation if they want to raise concerns.'
Sam Woods, Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation and Chief Executive Officer of the PRA, said:
“Protection for whistleblowers is an essential part of keeping the financial system safe and sound. Mr Staley’s behaviour fell below the standard we require, resulting in today’s fine and public censure. In addition, Barclays is now subject to special requirements to report to the PRA and FCA how it handles its whistleblowing cases in the coming years.'
Mr Staley attempted to identify the author of an anonymous letter received by Barclays in June 2016 that claimed to be from a Barclays shareholder. The letter contained various allegations, some of which concerned Mr Staley. Given his conflict Mr Staley should have maintained an appropriate distance; he should not have taken steps to identify the author. Mr Staley should have explicitly consulted fully with those with expertise and responsibility for whistleblowing in Barclays and sought express confirmation from them that what he wanted to do was permissible. He failed to do this.
The investigation found this to be a breach of the requirement to act with due skill, care and diligence (Individual Conduct Rule 2) but not a breach of the requirement to act with integrity (Individual Conduct Rule 1). As CEO, Mr Staley should have identified that:
He had a conflict of interest in relation to the letter, and needed to take particular care to maintain an appropriate distance from Group Compliance’s investigation.
There was a risk he would not be able to exercise impartial judgement in relation to how Barclays should respond.
Once the complaint was in the hands of the Group Compliance team, it was important that Group Compliance retained control over its investigation process.
This is the first case brought by the FCA and PRA under the Senior Managers Regime. The investigation found that Mr Staley made serious errors of judgement. While he made no personal gain in this instance, both regulators viewed his misconduct as sufficiently serious for each to impose a penalty of 10% of Mr Staley’s relevant annual income. Taking into account that he has settled at an early stage, Mr Staley has been fined a combined sum of £642,430. The FCA and PRA consider this to be appropriate and proportionate given the seniority of Mr Staley and the potential impact of the breach. In addition Mr Staley is censured by the publication of the regulators’ Final Notices.
Barclays
In light of Mr Staley’s actions above, the FCA and PRA have some concerns about the Firm’s whistleblowing systems and controls, and have concluded that these require enhanced monitoring and scrutiny. Barclays is, therefore, now subject to requirements by which it must report annually to the FCA and PRA, including any whistleblowing cases involving allegations made against its Senior Managers and any cases where Barclays has sought to identify any anonymous whistleblowers. Barclays’ Whistleblowers’ Champions, who are approved by the FCA and PRA under the Senior Managers Regime, will have to attest personally to the soundness of its whistleblowing systems and controls on an annual basis. These measures, which apply to all cases until the end of 2020, are the first of their kind applied to a regulated firm in relation to whistleblowing. Barclays agreed to the requirements. They are published today by the FCA and PRA.
Notes to editors

Mr Staley has been fined according to the FCA and PRA penalty regimes which each have five steps to calculate the level of the fines imposed. The detailed calculations are set out in both the PRA and FCA Final Notices. Mr Staley agreed to settle at an early stage of the regulators’ investigation and therefore qualified for a 30% reduction in the overall fine. Without this discount, the combined fine imposed by the FCA and PRA would have been £917,800. 


The relevant events occurred during the period when Barclays’ whistleblowing policy applied only to employees. It was not until 7 September 2016 that the FCA and the PRA introduced new rules requiring firms to provide whistleblowing protections for ‘reportable concerns’ raised by ‘any person’ (i.e. not just workers). These rules require that firms have ‘appropriate and effective whistleblowing arrangements in place’; this includes requiring that all employees have appropriate training in relation to whistleblowing processes.

FCA secures confiscation orders totalling £1.69 million against convicted insider dealers,Press Releases,11/05/2018,11/05/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-secures-confiscation-orders-totalling-1-69-million-against-convicted-insider-dealers,"These confiscation orders follow an FCA prosecution in which Messrs Dodgson and Hind were convicted of conspiring to insider deal. The existence of the conspiracy was proved by evidence of insider dealing in relation to five stocks. However, the total amounts to be confiscated include profits generated from trading in a further 23 stocks, which the FCA asserted amounted to insider dealing. As both defendants are deemed to have a criminal lifestyle due to the extent of their offending, the Court was able to assume that the profits made from other trading within a defined period also represented the proceeds of insider dealing and therefore their benefit from general criminal conduct. Mr Dodgson and Mr Hind did not seek to challenge that assumption in relation to their trading in the additional 23 stocks.
Mark Steward, the FCA’s Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight said:
“Mr Dodgson and Mr Hind hatched an audacious plan to make significant illegal gains for themselves. They were driven by greed and self-interest, but through their actions they have lost their liberty, their livelihoods and their reputations. Insider dealing is a serious crime that undermines our markets. The FCA will continue to ensure that those engaged in such activity are held to account for their misconduct.'
The Defendants were convicted on 9 May 2016 following a three-month trial. On 12 May 2016, Mr Dodgson was sentenced to 4 and a half years’ imprisonment and Mr Hind to 3 and a half years’ imprisonment.
The conspiracy operated between 1 November 2006 and 23 March 2010. During that time, Mr Dodgson held senior positions at Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers and Deutsche Bank. He used those positions to source inside information, which he passed on to his close friend, Mr Hind, who in turn caused trades to be placed for the benefit of both defendants.
The Defendants employed elaborate strategies designed to prevent the authorities from uncovering their activities. These included using unregistered mobile telephones, safety deposit boxes, and encoded and encrypted records. They also used multifarious methods to distribute the benefit they obtained from their criminal enterprise.
Whilst the Defendants went to great lengths in an effort to ensure that their pursuits went undetected, their meticulous record keeping ultimately proved to be their downfall in the confiscation proceedings. Those records detailed trading in a variety of stocks and the amounts that each was to benefit as a result. This made it far easier for the FCA to demonstrate the full extent of each defendant’s benefit from their criminal conduct.
Notes to editors
The confiscation orders were made on Friday 11 May 2018
Details of the Defendants’ convictions and sentences: 
Two convicted of insider dealing in Operation Tabernula trial
Insider dealers sentenced in Operation Tabernula trial

The Court declared that the Defendants derived a benefit of £1,124,096.31 and £624,521 from their respective criminal conduct.
The ‘sentence in default’ is the term of imprisonment to be imposed if a defendant does not satisfy his confiscation order. In the event that a sentence in default is served, a defendant is still required to satisfy the debt, as well as any interest that has accrued.
The FCA obtained restraint orders against Mr Dodgson and Mr Hind on 19 March 2010 in order to preserve the value of assets in which they had an interest pending the outcome of the FCA’s investigation and the conclusion of the prosecution and confiscation proceedings that followed.
The original criminal investigation was conducted in conjunction with the National Crime Agency.

Consumer Credit: 4 years of FCA regulation,News stories,27/03/2018,27/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/consumer-credit-4-years-fca-regulation,"In our video, above, Andrew Bailey talks about the changes we’ve made and our continuing commitment to ensuring that the consumer credit market meets the needs of society.
Over the last 4 years, we’ve made a lot of changes to the consumer credit market. We’ve taken strong action to protect people – introducing a price cap and new rules on payday lending that are saving borrowers around £150 million a year, and restricting the way credit brokers can charge fees. 
Firms that haven’t met our expectations have given over £900 million in redress back to customers. We’ve checked tens of thousands of firms are doing the right thing by their customers, and made those that don’t, leave the market.
We carefully supervise those that remain, especially those that pose more risk to their customers. Under our rules firms must lend responsibly and treat customers fairly – our changes to credit cards are set to save billions of pounds for millions of people by making firms do more to help customers repay debt more quickly, and we are looking closely at unarranged overdrafts.
We’ve made rent-to-own companies, who sell household goods for a weekly or monthly fee, be more transparent about charges and improve their standards, and supported nearly 350,000 of their customers in receiving £18 million in compensation. And we’re getting more help to the most vulnerable – improving the way debt management firms operate and directing over 20,000 people to free advice. We are doing more on high-cost credit products, including initiatives to encourage alternatives, and we’re working alongside other groups to address wider problems that are related to credit and debt.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Specifically, ESMA has agreed the following:
Prohibition on the marketing, distribution or sale of binary options to retail clients; and
Restrictions on the marketing, distribution or sale to retail clients of CFDs, including rolling spot forex and financial spread bets.
The restrictions applied to CFDs are:
leverage limits on the opening of a position between 30:1 and 2:1, depending on the price volatility of the underlying asset
a 50% margin close out rule applied on a per account basis
negative balance protection, limiting retail clients’ liability to the funds in their CFD trading account
a prohibition on firms offering monetary and non-monetary benefits (excluding research and information tools) to retail investors; and
a standardised risk warning, including firm-specific figures on the percentage of client accounts that have lost money trading CFDs.
ESMA intends to adopt the agreed measures in the official languages of the EU in the coming weeks, following which ESMA will publish an official notice on its website. The measures will be published in the Official Journal of the EU (OJ) and firms will be required to implement the prohibition on binary options, one month after publication in the OJ, and two months following the OJ publication, for the restrictions on CFDs.
The product intervention measures will be applied under Article 40 of the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR) and will have an initial duration of up to three months, after which the measures may be renewed.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) supports ESMA’s application of EU-wide temporary product intervention measures. The FCA expects to consult on whether to apply these measures on a permanent basis to firms offering CFDs and binary options to retail clients.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

FCA announces changes to advice on pension transfers,Press Releases,26/03/2018,26/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-announces-changes-advice-pension-transfers,"In June 2017, the FCA proposed changes to the rules on advice on transfers from safeguarded benefit schemes, mainly for transfers from defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution pension schemes. Following consultation, the FCA has published final rules to ensure transfer advice considers relevant factors.
The new rules include requiring transfer advice to be provided as a personal recommendation that takes account of a consumer’s individual circumstances. They also replace the current transfer value analysis with a requirement to undertake a personalised analysis of the consumer’s options and a comparison to show the value of the benefits being given up.
Following on from this work, the FCA has also published a consultation paper proposing further changes to its rules and guidance. This includes requiring advisers undertaking pension transfer advice to have the same qualifications as investment advisers. The FCA is also seeking views on whether it should intervene in relation to charging structures given the difficulty in managing the conflicts of interest that exist when providing transfer advice. This could include a ban on contingent charging, which is when a fee for advice is only paid for when a transfer goes ahead. This is a complex area, where any action taken may have an impact on access to advice.
The FCA has decided to maintain the position at this stage that an adviser should start from the assumption that a DB pension transfer will be unsuitable. This is to reflect the high proportion of unsuitable advice seen in supervisory work and need for further consideration of how transfer advice should be paid for. It should be noted that the existing guidance on the starting assumption does not, however, prevent an adviser from recommending a transfer where this is considered suitable for the consumer.
Christopher Woolard, FCA's Executive Director of Strategy and Competition said:
'Defined benefit pensions are valuable so most people will be best advised to keep them.  However, where people are considering a transfer, it is vital that they get good advice to enable them to make an informed decision.
'We are also looking at whether further changes are needed to improve the quality of advice in this area.  In particular, we recognise that there is an inherent conflict of interest when advisers use a contingent charging model so we are asking for views on whether we should ban contingent fees for pension transfer advice. Defined benefit pension transfer advice continues to be a key area of focus for the FCA.'

Policy Statement 18/6: Advising on Pension Transfers
Consultation Paper 18/7: Improving the quality of pension transfer advice
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

FCA wins case against Capital Alternatives Limited and others,Press Releases,26/03/2018,29/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-wins-case-against-capital-alternatives-limited-and-others,"In summary, the schemes involved:
African Land (also known as Agri Capital) which offered investments in rice farm harvests in Sierra Leone, run by African Land Limited; and
Reforestation Projects (also known as Capital Carbon Credits) which offered investments in carbon credits intended to be generated from land in Sierra Leone, Brazil and Australia, run by Reforestation Projects Limited.
The decision comes following protracted proceedings, an appeal and an eventual trial which took place over 22 days and concluded in October 2017.
Mark Steward, Executive Director at FCA Enforcement and Market Oversight Division, said:
'This judgment should send a clear message to all of those who use corporate facades to sell dubious investments. We will do what it takes to hold them to account for their misconduct.
'We are acutely aware from experience that the risk to investors who deal with unauthorised firms is that most, if not all, investors are likely only to get a fraction of their money back.
'Consumers should recognise that there are huge risks involved when investing with unauthorised businesses.'
Background
Between 2009 and 2013, consumers were persuaded to invest in rice farm harvests in Sierra Leone and in carbon credits intended to be generated from land in Sierra Leone, Brazil and Australia. The FCA launched legal action in July 2013 in respect of the operation and promotion of the four schemes and also in respect of the false and misleading statements made to consumers by individuals involved with the schemes.
Collective investment schemes can be a risky investment so only authorised firms and individuals can operate them. This is to protect consumers’ interests if a scheme goes wrong. None of the defendants in these proceedings were authorised to undertake regulated activities.
Next steps
If the decision is not subject to further appeal by the Defendants, the FCA can proceed to obtain monies from the Defendants to return to affected consumers. In the meantime, the FCA is seeking new injunctions restraining the assets of some of the defendants.

The FCA strongly advise you to only deal with financial firms that are authorised by us, and check the Financial Services Register to ensure they are. It has information on firms and individuals that are, or have been, regulated by us.

Alex Hope Sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment for Perverting the Course of Justice,Press Releases,23/03/2018,23/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/alex-hope-sentenced-16-months-imprisonment-perverting-course-justice,"In sentencing him, Her Honour Judge Taylor highlighted the blatant and repeated nature of his offending and his continued flouting of court orders.
Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement & Market Oversight at the FCA, said:
“Mr Hope repeatedly misled the courts and the FCA, concealing monies that should have been used to compensate the victims of his crimes. Throughout the course of proceedings, he has shown contempt not only to the court, but also those he has harmed. Today’s outcome sends a clear message. We will continue to pursue wrongdoers and hold them fully to account.'
Today’s outcome follows earlier action taken by the FCA against Mr Hope as a result of his criminal conduct.
On 30 January 2015 at Southwark Crown Court, Mr Hope was sentenced to a total of 7 years’ imprisonment for defrauding over 100 investors of more than £5.5 million by operating a collective investment scheme without authorisation. He persuaded them to part with their money on the promise that it would be invested on foreign exchange markets and generate significant returns. In reality, most of the monies were used to fund Mr Hope’s lavish lifestyle.
On 12 February 2016, a confiscation order in the sum of £166,696 was made against Mr Hope. He was ordered to pay the sum within 3 months. The Court ordered all monies confiscated from Mr Hope to be used to compensate the victims of his crimes and that a further £2.65 million held in his bank and trading accounts to be returned directly to investors.
By 27 September 2016, he had paid just £1,000 in satisfaction of his confiscation order and was committed to prison for an additional 603 days at a hearing before the City of Westminster Magistrates’ Court.
In the months between the making of the confiscation order and his committal to prison, Mr Hope opened 5 new bank accounts, which he used to receive in excess of £75,000. The majority of those funds were withdrawn in cash or used to fund his lifestyle. On one occasion, he obtained €25,000 in €200 notes from a money service bureau in Victoria. He also used the accounts to purchase tickets to a Rihanna concert at Wembley Stadium and an Anthony Joshua fight at the O2 amongst other things. All of this activity was carried out at a time when Mr Hope was on ‘day release’ from HMP Ford to attend a work placement in Central London and whilst serving the 7 year sentence imposed in January 2015.
Mr Hope’s activities were also in breach of the terms of a restraint order made in accordance with the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 by Southwark Crown Court in April 2012. That order prevented Mr Hope from dealing with, disposing of or diminishing the value of any asset in which he had an interest and barred him from operating a bank account without the consent of the FCA or an order of the Crown Court. In addition, under that order, Mr Hope was required to disclose his financial position to the FCA and the Crown Court. He did not. Instead, he repeatedly misled the FCA, Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service and judges of the Magistrates’ and Crown Courts about his ability to satisfy his confiscation order.
On 30 November 2017, Mr Hope was released from prison whereupon he was arrested and charged with perverting the course of justice. He appeared before Camberwell Green Magistrates’ Court later that day and has been remanded in custody since.

Women in finance: keeping up the pressure for progress,Speeches,22/03/2018,11/04/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/women-finance-keeping-pressure-progress,"Speaker: Megan Butler, Director of Supervision - Investment, Wholesale and SpecialistsEvent: Women in Finance Summit, LondonDelivered: 22 March 2018Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version
Highlights:
Diversity is a key supervisory issue for the FCA.
Firms with monocultures are significantly more likely to have governance-related issues.
We need to keep up the pressure on creating change.
Targets on gender diversity are an option for firms to consider.
When I spoke here a year ago it was pointed out that I struck a pessimistic tone when talking about the possibility of positive change towards a more diverse, open, tolerant and learning culture within financial services. But it has also been pointed out that more recently my tone seems to have changed.
Am I more optimistic?
The short answer is yes.
Having worked in this industry for 30 years without seeing much change, something has happened in the last year. A year ago, I was able to talk about the high-level sense of engagement from the leaders of some parts of financial services. Today we are seeing an even more serious and positive debate about women in finance.
Last year I was told by a senior figure in the asset management industry that gender and the diversity question was not for the regulator. I do not hear this argument any more. So my sense is that business sentiment genuinely seems to have shifted since the last year.
my sense is that business sentiment genuinely seems to have shifted since the last year.
So what has prompted this change?
Firstly, the continuing success of the Women in Finance Charter. Secondly, publication of the gender pay gap data (of which more in a moment), shining a light on some awkward statistics. Thirdly, we cannot ignore the #MeToo movement, and the growing sentiment that enough is enough in the creation of toxic environments that belittle and harm women.

Only around 13% of FCA-approved individuals in trading firms are women. A figure that rises, slightly, to 16% in investment management. The best is approximately 19% in general insurance and 18% in retail banking.
The financials of the gender pay gap
The gender pay gap is also striking. Some banks have reported gender disparities of around 50% for wages and 80% for bonuses. Others are now releasing equally bad or indeed worse data. It will make difficult reading for a number of firms. My main point this morning is therefore a simple one: we need to keep up the pressure for progress. And, for reasons I’ll come to shortly, the FCA is heavily invested in making sure this happens.
Before I do that though, there is an important point to make about why we should care. Because, in order to drive change in financial services, we cannot exclusively focus on arguments around social justice – although it is clearly a matter of social justice. We need to call out the fact that diversity is fundamental to business success and to the reduction of failure.
I appreciate that this is quite a clinical point, and not necessarily an approach that captures the public mood on gender issues right now. Quite rightly, many women (and many men) see the issue in starker terms and don’t necessarily feel it requires justification. But ultimately, in order to win minds it is also important to convey the point that diversity – including gender diversity – confers significant advantages on firms.
First, they will make more money. And I don’t just mean firms make more money by encouraging gender diversity on non-trading desks such as marketing and HR, as important as these functions are. I mean that they make more money everywhere. Including the kind of profit and loss functions typically dominated by men.
So to illustrate my point here: we know that women as investors reliably outperform men by 1.1%, with lower risk and volatility. We know that mixed-gender investment fund teams attract 6% more inflows than teams run solely by men. And we know also that a strong female presence at board level translates into significantly higher RoE for firms.
So the financials around gender diversity are pretty compelling. But the advantage does not end there. This is about more than making more money. Firms that promote gender diversity also significantly lower their conduct risk. And this is where the FCA’s interest comes in. Firms with monocultures suffer 24% more governance-related issues than their peers.
Why do we see this?
One answer is that we know that when a team includes more women, its collective intelligence rises. The other is a more general point around encouraging different perspectives to reduce the risk of groupthink. Behavioural scientists know that people tend to change their own assessments to bring them into line with those around them - a kind of social proofing.
We also know that some teams are especially prone to excessively optimistic views of their own skills. And that those teams tend to be more close-minded. A classic trait in groups that lack diversity. Gender diversity – and indeed diversity in more general terms – can help groups from converging around poor decisions.
The important point here is that most people who work within financial services are not intrinsically immoral.
You can see these poor decisions right across the risk spectrum from the financial crisis to FX market manipulation. There was a clear ethical drift in that market. What we found was a microculture on Spot FX trading desks that created, over time, an environment where unacceptable behaviour became the norm.
The important point here is that most people who work within financial services are not intrinsically immoral. So, as regulators, we need to concentrate on changing the barrel – the culture – and not just the bad apples.
Now, there are lots of reasons as to why good people do bad things – including reciprocity and herding behaviour - that were glaringly obvious in the chatroom messages we uncovered between Spot FX traders.
How and why regulators encourage diversity
For regulators this is fundamental. As a regulator we have gone beyond a mindset of compliance where rules are enough.
Last week the FCA published a Discussion Paper on transforming culture in financial services. This is part of our drive to promote a discussion and consensus on the essential features of a healthy culture within financial services. We want to raise the management of culture within firms, as a leadership discipline, to meet the level of rigour and importance as risk management and strategic planning.
We want to raise the management of culture within firms, as a leadership discipline, to meet the level of rigour and importance as risk management and strategic planning.
Prominent in this conversation is the pursuit of diversity in the workplace. A culture that pursues diversity is one that will have wider benefits for an organisation. A culture that is open minded, tolerant, considerate, and importantly, aspiring to improve.
This is a year of anniversaries: 100 years since the first step towards women’s suffrage here in the UK. But also 10 years since the financial crisis. Last weekend was the anniversary of JP Morgan’s purchase of Bear Sterns. In six months we will have the 10th anniversary of the Lehman failure. Other failures or near misses followed.
When I look back on these failures of the past and the cultures in which they grew, ’open minded’, ‘tolerant’, ‘considerate’ and ‘learning’ are not the words that come to mind.
In the UK, our focus is on the Senior Managers and Certification Regime which is transforming the culture of accountability across financial services. We see this as a step change: placing an onus on individuals to take responsibility for their actions and ensuring that those individuals are fit and proper to perform their role. In real terms, this means that our supervision teams will continue to impress on senior management the importance of diversity in their teams.
How to achieve diversity?
This requires a focus at every single level of an organisation. You cannot solve this problem by parachuting in a handful of senior women.  
So our supervisors may ask directly about gender diversity policies:
Are you recruiting an even split of female and male graduates?
Are those female graduates rising through the ranks in equal numbers? And if not, do you understand why?
Does equal pay and the pay gap get attention in your firm?
Can your business do more to promote environments that appeal to women and give them confidence?
This is not easy and there is no silver bullet. But the industry should be clear that the current pace of change on gender diversity must not just be a flash in the pan, but must be maintained. On current trends, financial services globally will not reach 50% female executive committee representation until around 2107 – two hundred years after the first suffrage march on Parliament.
We have seen a shift over the last decade on FTSE-100 boards. A change achieved, in large part, thanks to the presence of a measurable goal set by the 30% Club.
On current trends, financial services globally will not reach 50% female executive committee representation until around 2107

Now, I am conscious that targets are not universally popular - least of all with women. And this was, as it happens, a concern I shared for a number of years.
The idea of being seen to benefit from positive discrimination can be uncomfortable. The creeping progress that financial services have made over the last 20 years changed my mind.
Perhaps some firms feel they can achieve change in the long run more quickly via other means. This is their choice. It helps firms to make money and better decisions. Better decisions that can bring benefit to society, as well as cause less harm. But we will challenge on the steps being taken to achieve change, because ultimately, embracing the value of diversity benefits everyone.
The FCA approach to gender diversity
This brings me to my last point today: policy makers are not a special exception. I am proud that I work for an organisation that has a well-established commitment to diversity and inclusion. We don’t take a narrow view on this, it’s about how we reflect society and being able to bring your whole self to work. And recognition of the fact that to be effective and efficient, the FCA needs to recruit, develop and keep the most talented, engaged and diverse workforce. On top of this, we have signed up to the Women in Finance Charter – targeting 45% of our senior leadership team identifying as female by 2020. 50pc by 2025. 
We are not there yet. Our senior leadership team is 36% female and 64% male. Our gender pay gap is 19.28%. This is a differential demonstrating we still have a long way to go. The UK’s average gender pay gap is 18.1%. In finance, it’s 37.4%. But we are making progress. It is encouraging that 45% of our managers are female. And I am also pleased to report that the FCA has taken important steps in other areas. So, for example, we have tied performance-related pay to delivery of executive team objectives on diversity. We also have an Executive Board member for gender diversity – my colleague Christopher Woolard.
We will publish progress against our targets in areas like pay and diversity. And we have progressive policies in place around flexible working, parental leave and so on.
Conclusion
But there is more to do. The event at the President’s Club, although we did not see major financial service firms in attendance, shows how much more there is to be done and how unsafe it is to assume that the commitment to the value of diversity has safe and secure roots. We must take nothing for granted. A point underlined by the fact that one of our female supervisors was recently referred to as ‘little lady’ by a senior leader from one of the UK’s biggest banks.
My hope is that we can finally leave this sort of throwaway comment in the past.
one of our female supervisors was recently referred to as ‘little lady’ by a senior leader from one of the UK’s biggest banks.
And on a purely personal level, what I would genuinely love is that when I walk into a meeting with senior industry representatives, I am not the only woman in the room. That is why events like this are so important, and why the leadership of people here today is absolutely crucial. The work of those here today is a powerful reminder of what can be achieved, and how quickly it can be achieved, when people come together to make a difference.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority
British and Australian regulators strengthen cooperation on FinTech through Enhanced Cooperation Agreement,Press Releases,22/03/2018,22/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/british-and-australian-regulators-strengthen-cooperation-fintech-through-enhanced-cooperation,"In this enhanced agreement, the FCA and ASIC have agreed to explore ways to quicken the licensing process in terms of the authorisation of innovative businesses that are already authorised in the other jurisdiction. Where a business is a participant in either Authority’s regulatory sandbox and would like to enter the other’s, the FCA and ASIC will endeavour to facilitate that participation.
The FCA and ASIC will also look to co-host FinTech and regtech events, conduct joint policy work, research and experimentation and explore secondment opportunities. They will work to raise topics or approaches of common interest at an international level to promote greater levels of international cooperation on financial innovation.
Christopher Woolard, FCA’s Executive Director of Strategy and Competition, said,
‘Today’s enhanced agreement underscores the FCA’s and ASIC’s commitment to a deeper level of cooperation on Fintech. Cooperation between regulators is a vital part of helping innovative businesses across international jurisdictions to flourish and bring their products to market for the benefit of consumers. Back in 2016 when we signed the original agreement with ASIC, we stated that we hoped that it would be the first of many to come. I am pleased to say that this has certainly been the case.’
Signing the enhanced Agreement, ASIC Commissioner John Price said, ‘ASIC and the FCA have developed an immensely beneficial relationship on FinTech, including through our quarterly information sharing calls. We are delighted this extension will offer FinTechs the opportunity to spread good ideas across borders. We will work together to raise topics and approaches of common interest at an international level.’
Under this new agreement ASIC and the FCA will continue to refer innovative FinTech businesses to each other for advice and support via their respective Innovation Hubs.
Building on cooperation agreements such as the one signed today with ASIC, the FCA also recently asked for views on the merits of creating a global sandbox. This could potentially allow firms to conduct tests in different jurisdictions at the same time and allow regulators to work together and identify and solve common cross-border regulatory problems. The FCA will consider all feedback received, discuss the concept with international regulators such as ASIC and expects to provide a further update in due course.
Notes to editors
Enhanced Cooperation Agreement (PDF)
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.
In October 2014, the FCA launched its Innovation Hub to encourage innovation in financial services by supporting innovator businesses with a range of services. The work of the FCA’s Innovation Hub is closely tied to the FCA’s objective of promoting effective competition in the interest of consumers.

FCA sets out its Approach to Supervision and Enforcement,Press Releases,21/03/2018,21/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-sets-out-its-approach-supervision-and-enforcement,"When the FCA launched its Mission, it committed to publishing a series of documents that would explain its approach to regulation in more depth. These articulate how the FCA carries out its main activities, aiming to provide transparency to its thought process and decision-making. 
The Approach to Supervision shows how the FCA aims to be more forward-looking and pre-emptive in its supervision of firms. Firms’ strategies and cultures are at the root cause of most major failings. Supervision’s proactive engagement with firms will focus on business models and the drivers of behaviour in firms. Supervision will prioritise its activities according to the greatest risk of harm. The Approach document explains how the FCA has an intelligence-driven and data-led approach that enables it to take prompt and incisive action once harm has been identified.
The Approach to Enforcement outlines how the FCA conducts investigations and its powers. It also shows how enforcement sets out to achieve fair and just outcomes in response to misconduct and to ensure FCA rules and requirements are obeyed. The overriding principle in the FCA approach to enforcement is substantive justice – to ensure we carry out investigations in a consistent and open-minded way to get the right outcomes.
Andrew Bailey, FCA Chief Executive said:
'The most visible parts of the FCA’s work, supervision and enforcement are critical to helping us fulfil our objectives. For supervision this means overseeing regulated firms to identify, prevent or reduce harm to consumers and markets. And for enforcement our overriding principle is to provide substantive justice, aiming to achieve fair and just outcomes in response to misconduct and to ensure our rules and requirements are followed.
'We hope today’s Approach documents outline clearly and in a transparent way, exactly how we fulfil our objectives through supervision and enforcement activity and why we make the decisions in the manner that we do. We are committed to continually improving our models and driving progress.'
Both approach documents ask whether they set out the FCA’s respective approaches to supervision and enforcement clearly and whether there are other issues that could benefit from further clarification.
Both approach documents are open for consultation until 21 June 2018. The final approach documents will be published later this year.

FCA announces redress scheme for rent-to-own firm PerfectHome,Press Releases,20/03/2018,20/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-announces-redress-scheme-rent-own-firm-perfecthome,"PerfectHome (a trading name of Temple Finance Limited) is a rent-to-own firm which provides household goods to customers on hire purchase agreements.
Responsibility for regulating the rent-to-own sector transferred from the Office of Fair Trading to the FCA in April 2014. Following this we identified that the firm’s affordability assessments did not adequately take into account customer circumstances which led to customers being issued with loans they could not afford.
In addition collections processes did not always deliver good outcomes for customers with some customers being charged late fees for arrears on their insurance contracts, contrary to the firm’s own policy, customers paying for insurance before receiving goods and customers not always receiving a refund of their first payment where the agreement was cancelled before goods were delivered.
In response to these concerns PerfectHome has conducted a major programme of improvements to ensure that loans are affordable and customers are treated fairly throughout the collections process.
PerfectHome has identified customers that may have been treated unfairly in the past and has committed to pay redress to these customers.
The scheme proposes redress for customers in four sets of circumstances:
£1.7 million relates to 4,000 customers where it was found that affordability assessments were not completed satisfactorily.  This meant, in some cases, customer circumstances were not sufficiently considered and loans were issued that may not have been affordable for customers.
The remaining redress relates to:
incorrectly charged late fees;
insurance payments made prior to the delivery of goods; and
initial payments made against sales that were subsequently cancelled.
Jonathan Davidson, Executive Director of Supervision – Retail and Authorisations at the FCA said:
“Our key priority is to ensure all financial firms lend responsibly and treat consumers fairly; especially those in financial difficulties or who are vulnerable.
“Unaffordable lending is not acceptable in any circumstances. I am pleased that the firm has taken steps to address this and provide redress to those customers affected.
“PerfectHome have recently been authorised by the FCA following substantial improvements to its business practices.
“This package of redress continues the FCA’s work with the rent-to-own sector to resolve the concerns we have previously identified.'
PerfectHome will contact all affected customers to explain the refund or balance adjustment they will receive. Customers do not need to take any action until they are contacted.
Around 2,425 customers whose loans were unaffordable, which led to them defaulting, will have their debts written off by the firm.  They will also become the owners of the goods they originally got the loan for.

The FCA authorised PerfectHome to carry out, amongst others, hire purchase agreements on the 14 December 2017.

Beyond regulation: thinking creatively about consumer credit,Speeches,20/03/2018,20/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/beyond-regulation-thinking-creatively-about-consumer-credit,"Speaker: Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy and CompetitionLocation: Responsible Finance Conference, GlasgowDelivered on: 20 March 2018
Highlights:
Since taking over regulation of the credit sector in 2014, we’ve made huge progress in ensuring the market is fairer, cleaner and more sustainable.
Traditional regulatory interventions are only one part of the story. In order to enact real change, we also need to think creatively about the challenges this market throws up.
A key part of our approach is drawing on the abilities of others to influence demand in the market.
We support firms in developing innovative business models that answer genuine consumer need.
Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version.
It is a privilege to be here today amongst people who continue to strive to do better for people using credit in Scotland and beyond.
I want to start my comments today by thinking about those very people.
There’s a danger, when you’re up to your neck in policy proposals, economic analysis and focus group findings, that you could forget that regulation of the credit sector is not a cold academic exercise.
Those of us engaged with this issue know the truth: that for millions of people credit is woven through the fabric of everyday life.
Here in Glasgow 41% of adults have outstanding, non-mortgage debt, with 11% of adults in particularly high-cost credit debt.
While across the UK as a whole, there are over 24 million people with debt on credit products.
For the millions of people behind these stats, credit represents very different things.
From a convenient means of collecting air miles on your daily spending to keeping your car on the road; from improving your house to needing to borrow to be able to cook the kids’ tea; from a sum that is easily repaid month on month to a constant worry.
The task of regulating an industry of this complexity can be a daunting one.
When the ramifications for ordinary people are so profound, how do we strike the balance between protection and access? Between demanding rigorous standards while leaving some space for original thinking?
It would - seemingly – be easy for us to simply reach for a regulatory stick, but the use of credit in many cases is fundamental to people’s lives, unavoidable even.
A market like this, where the consequences of our decisions are so acute, requires us to get under the skin of a series of complex problems and think creatively about the solutions we apply to them. They say necessity is the mother of invention, after all.
The people in this room are a vital part of this.
In order to be truly effective we also have to look beyond our own four walls, and beyond what might normally we expected of a regulator.
But in order to be truly effective we also have to look beyond our own four walls, and beyond what might normally we expected of a regulator.
Our approach has four components:
We authorise, supervise and enforce against our existing rules
We intervene and propose new rules where they are needed
We work with others to address failure in the market and influence demand
And we promote competition and innovation in the interests of consumers
I’d like to talk today about what this looks like in practice.
Putting things right
Regulating day-to-day is the most obvious thing people would expect the FCA to do.
As many in this room will be aware, our history in the credit sector began in 2014 when we took over the regulation of the industry from the Office of Fair Trading.
Since then we’ve worked hard to build up our knowledge of the sector and take action where it was most sorely needed.
A key part of this is ensuring that our existing rules are being upheld – this is the first quarter in the four-piece puzzle.
Areas like rent-to-own have fallen straight into this bracket.
We know that customers in this sector are amongst the most vulnerable, with a median annual income of around £16,000 in 2016, about £4,000 a year less than the typical individual income.
Evidence suggests people who use rent-to-own products have fewer options available to them. But, the impact of repayments, which can dwarf the cost of the item itself thanks to extra charges, is a concern, as is the degree to which consumers consider them when making a purchase.
And then there’s the way in which consumers are treated when engaging with this sector.
Our investigation into BrightHouse, the UK’s largest rent-to-own retailer, found that customers may have been treated unfairly, with processes falling short of our expectations. So, we took action, and the firm paid out over £14.8 million in redress to nearly 250,000 customers.
In fact, combined with the compensation paid out by Buy As You View due to poor practice, we’ve secured compensation for over 300,000 customers of rent-to-own firms who were engaged in poor practices – nearly £16 million worth in fact.
And that doesn’t include the package of redress of £2.1 million agreed by PerfectHome, which we announced today, made up of cash payments and balance write-offs for 37,000 customers.
Identifying and filling gaps in regulation
In total, we’ve secured £900 million worth of redress for consumers from firms across a number of sectors whose lending practices didn’t meet our standards – a not inconsiderable sum to have been collected in only four years.
It shouldn’t be a surprise that we are taking such action – it’s the bread and butter of our job. But that job is not only about enforcing our rules; it’s also about looking beyond existing regulation to identify any gaps. And we’ve already made some significant changes.
Only last month we announced new rules for credit card firms following our market study, in which we analysed the accounts of 34 million credit card customers.
These rules focus on persistent credit card debt. Debt of this type, when customers pay more in interest, fees and charges than they do of the actual amount borrowed, can have a corrosive impact. And by our estimates, 4 million accounts are affected.
Customers in persistent debt pay on average around £2.50 in interest and charges for every £1 that they repay of their borrowing – but are profitable for firms.
The new rules will tackle this head on.
When a customer has been in persistent debt over 18 months, their credit card provider will have to prompt them to change their repayment behaviour if they can afford to, and signpost them to debt help and advice if they need it.
If the customer remains in persistent debt after 36 months, the firm must offer them a way to repay the balance in a reasonable period. If that’s not possible for the customer, the firm must show forbearance. This may include reducing, waiving or cancelling any interest, fees or charges. 
We estimate that these changes will save consumers somewhere between £310 million and £1.3 billion a year in lower interest charges, while also reducing consumer stress and financial difficulties by resolving debt problems sooner.
The rules are designed to prompt firms and consumers to act before they reach the 36-month point and we will be watching carefully to see how they are implemented in practice.
This isn’t just about helping consumers in need, but changing the incentives for firms.
Another significant change we’ve made in the market is our regulation of high-cost short-term credit, commonly called pay day lending, including the price cap we introduced in 2015.
This has substantially reduced the cost of borrowing. In fact, our research shows that since the cap was introduced the amount consumers pay per loan has dropped from over £100 to £60, saving roughly £150 million for users of high-cost short-term credit every year.
We’ve taken great strides to ensure the market is fairer, cleaner and more sustainable.
We’ve taken great strides to ensure the market is fairer, cleaner and more sustainable.
But I am not naïve enough to suggest that everything in the garden is rosy.
For example, a startling finding to come out of our Financial Lives survey is that 4.1 million people are in financial difficulty in the UK. That’s 4.1 million people who have failed to meet credit commitments or pay domestic bills in three or more of the last six months.
Meanwhile, 50% of the UK adult population show signs of potential vulnerability. That’s over 25 million people who are at increased risk of financial harm, or would suffer disproportionately if harm occurred.
In Scotland, where we are today, that percentage rises to 54%.
Against this backdrop, we’re also still seeing aspects of the credit sector that concern us.
Take for example unarranged overdrafts, where we can observe disproportionately high fees and charges.
In fact, our research shows that there appears to be no clear relationship between the amount borrowed by the consumers and the amount charged by the firm.
Based on our early findings, we believe that there is a case to consider fundamental reform of unarranged overdrafts.
Before we reach final conclusions, we need to complete more analysis, for example to be sure that there aren’t any knock-on effects or unintended consequences of any action we might take. But the evidence gathered so far reinforces our concerns about this particular part of the market. And we won’t shy away from taking action if we deem it necessary.
Beyond regulation
So we’re taking action on behalf of consumers but we know there’s more work to do.
As I’ve just described, we see a case for intervention in a number of markets – and we are prepared to propose new rules where necessary.
But in order to be effective, we also have to accept that there is a limit to what can be achieved through traditional regulatory interventions.
Authorising, supervising, enforcing and writing new policy have their place, and we’ll not flinch from taking action against players who don’t meet our standards, including removing them from the market.
But classic regulation can’t provide all the answers. In order to have the greatest impact we also need to recognise the limitations of our powers. We need to draw on the abilities of others to drive change forward.
We need to draw on the abilities of others to drive change forward.
This is the third part of our approach – working with others to influence demand in the market – and high-cost credit is a clear example of how this can work.
For example, we know that consumers moving into social housing at short notice often turn to this sort of credit when their accommodation is unfurnished. Recognising this, some local authorities and social landlords have set up schemes to provide essential goods to tenants, with real success.
Yet, currently there is no formal mechanism for sharing expertise so that such schemes can be rolled out more widely. Some say a fear of our own regulatory requirements may also be acting as a disincentive for some social landlords.
It is in these sorts of areas, often overlooked or even unobserved in traditional discussions around the credit market, that we – as a collective - can make a real difference.
This is also a case study in why simply restricting access to credit is not the answer.
While we may be able to limit supply, restricting demand is a very different matter and this particular case is a visceral example of the vital role credit can play in someone’s life. At its simplest: how do you cook a meal and do your kids have a bed to sleep in?
So we have to look beyond the accepted boundaries and focus our efforts where they can make the biggest difference.
More broadly we have to look to the market itself and ask why more lower cost, lower risk options aren’t more widely available. What is standing in the way of greater competition and choice for consumers?
A customer with a good credit score might pay around £280 to borrow £4,000 for a year, while it could cost a riskier customer over £1,500. But where are the missing rungs on the ladder? What are the options for mid-cost credit?
The £22 million lent by responsible finance providers to over 55,000 individuals in 2016-17 is proof of the impact the sector is having.
But it’s still tiny compared to the scale of high-cost lending. Just look at high-cost home-collected credit and rent-to-own agreements where a total of £1.9 billion was lent in 2016.
Those statistics underline the challenge. Even if tomorrow, with the aid of a magic wand, we fixed every regulatory bump, information gap or co-ordination problem in the market, and we saw high-cost customers switch to mid-cost lending, the fact is that existing providers would be overwhelmed by demand.
So we have to look at business models and the supply of capital in this market.
I’ll say a bit more on models in a second. But capital is outside of our control. We welcome today’s announcements from Government and the alliance about potential dormant asset and philanthropic funding.
What we hope to see is more models emerge in this market that can provide commercially sustainable, mid-cost lending.
The economics of this do not operate in a vacuum, either. If you look at firms like Five Lamps, they couple lending with money advice – which is about long term outcomes, not just lending. Commercially, it means lower default rates.
Indeed, in the wider thinking and partnership needed here, we would see debt advice as an important part of the picture.
This is particularly true for vulnerable consumers who may find themselves shut out of financial services, without the access or resources many of us take for granted.
On this issue in particular we are seeing positive movement.
Peter Wyman’s recent report, which seeks more debt advice, more efficiently delivered across the mediums consumers most readily use, echoes our own ambitions for the sector.
The report also recognises something we have seen in our own work – that a piecemeal approach is doomed to failure.
In the debt advice space, the key is joined-up thinking: providers thinking fully about how consumers interact with them, and working together to tackle issues holistically. The same is true of regulation as a whole.
I want now to return to business models, and in particular innovation, as my fourth, and final, point.
Thinking out of the (sand) box by testing new products
The final component of our approach concerns innovation and its role in securing better outcomes for consumers.
Effective markets rely on competition: the ability of consumers to exercise choice, voting with their feet if they see that their needs can be better met elsewhere.
Our role at the FCA is to ensure consumers are empowered to make those choices and that innovation is free to play its part in driving value.
But we understand that firms have to be given space and support in order to innovate in the interests of consumers.
That’s why we created our regulatory sandbox, a safe spacefor firms to test new products – the first of its kind.
The sandbox is reducing the time and cost of getting innovative ideas to market: 90% of firms from the first cohort have gone on to market, with many firms finding it easier to access capital as a result of ‘playing’ in the sandbox.
And the products and services we’re seeing coming through are answering genuine consumer need.
Some of what we have seen really speaks to the challenges in this space.
Like the mobile app using behavioural economics to encourage consumers to set aside small amounts in a saving account – allowing them to repay high-cost credit obligations faster.
Or the platform that holds users’ current account, credit card and pension balances in one place, in a simple format – facilitating better financial management.
But many see this as a space where we are just interested in FinTech firms.
The truth is that it really is for all innovators, all cutting edge ideas. We have been really clear that if there are firms that want to test new ideas in the responsible or mid-cost finance space, we want to hear from you.
Conclusion
To conclude, be it though intervention or innovation, the FCA’s commitment to ensuring fair outcomes for users of consumer credit is absolute.
Our guiding principle is, and has always been, that markets must work for those who use them.
But to do that we have to think with imagination, working with and learning from others, breaking new ground and drawing on the technological opportunities of our time.
Much progress has already been made. But we still have work to do. We’ll roll up our sleeves and get stuck in where action is needed.
And with the support of partners, we can continue to shape a market that genuinely serves the millions of people who rely on it.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Transforming culture in financial services,Speeches,19/03/2018,19/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/transforming-culture-financial-services,"Speaker: Andrew Bailey, Chief ExecutiveEvent: Transforming culture in financial services conference, LondonDelivered: 19 March 2018Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version
Highlights
Work on firm culture is embedded in the work of our supervisors and is an important priority for the FCA.
Essays in our Discussion Paper on transforming culture in financial services indicate that culture is about encouraging and incentivising good things, not just stopping bad things from happening.
The Senior Managers Regime and measures to govern the payment of remuneration are important developments in creating incentives for good culture.
Cast your minds back just over 2 years to New Year’s Eve 2015. Why? The FCA was criticised for announcing that it was placing the lead responsibility for its culture work under its Business Plan with its Supervision Departments. It was interpreted as a downgrading of the importance of this work. As a Board member at the time, I found this reaction odd. Work on firm culture is naturally embedded in the work of our supervisors, for whom it is an important priority. It has been pursued diligently by Supervision ever since, and will continue to be so, and today’s conference and the publication are a part, but only a part, of our work.
There is, though, an important point about culture which underlines why it should be an important task of conduct supervision. Culture is not naturally pursued by a regulator like the FCA by making rules. We would not achieve much by making a rule which said that all firms should have a good culture. I want to be clear however, and I will come back to this point, that culture in firms is influenced by the rules we make and the incentives they create, so there is a very important role for our rules, but it is not a direct prescribing of culture.
Moreover, there are important elements of culture that are outside most of the direct influences of our rules. We do expect people to come to work and follow good values without needing to make a rule to require it. Of course, in reality what happens varies a lot, and it is the job of our supervisors to observe and through their interactions with firms to set expectations consistent with our public interest objectives. There are times in my career as a supervisor when I have summoned a firm in and said ‘we expect better from you’. And, of course, we have to use supervisory and enforcement tools when misconduct is identified or suspected.
Unfortunately, if you look back over the last decade and more, we have seen too many instances of misconduct, some of which we are still dealing with. As supervisors, our objective is to prevent misconduct, not just clear up the messes when they happen. No supervisor can guarantee good conduct at all times, much though we wish it, but we do expect to act to pre-empt and anticipate poor conduct, and society has a right to expect this.
Understanding drivers of poor conduct
If you follow this line of argument, I think it is natural that as a public interest authority, we want to do all we can to understand the drivers of poor conduct so that we can seek to prevent them. A little over a year ago, I did some work to prepare for a speech I gave in Hong Kong on culture in which I looked back at the history of corporate executive remuneration in the US since the Great Depression of the 1930s. I found the evidence very interesting.
In essence, the system that operated from the Great Depression until the 1980s had relied on the legacy of the 1930s and an almost unstated code in society that the remuneration of senior corporate executives should not increase beyond a quite limited multiple of average pay on the basis that to breach this relationship would be viewed as ostentatious and breaking a norm that acted as a glue in society more broadly.
Things changed from around the early 1980s. You can label it the ‘Greed is Good’ era if you can remember the first Wall Street film with Michael Douglas. It is also often labelled as the era in which so-called agency theory came to prominence, in which corporate governance was used to change the policies under which a manager (agent) operates, and thereby emphasise the interests of the owner (principal). This led to a rapid increase in senior executive pay as the limits of the previous social norm were replaced by an approach which used remuneration to incentivise performance. Broadly, this approach held up to the global financial crisis, certainly in financial services.
This ‘glue in society’ is interestingly reflected in the overall pattern of income growth in the US. Between 1917 and 1948, the real income of the lower 90% of earners in the US grew at 1.43% per annum, more than double the 0.50% growth rate per annum for the top 10%. For the 1948-1972 period, the real incomes of both groups grew markedly more rapidly, at an average of 2.58% per annum, more than double that of the 1917 to 1948 period, and while the real incomes of the lower 90% grew by 2.46% per annum, those of the top 10% grew by 2.65%, quite a remarkable uniformity. And then it changed. Between 1972 and 2013, average real income growth for all employees was 0.48% per annum, but with the top 10% growing at 1.42% per annum and the lower 90% at -0.17% per annum. That is a notable change in income distribution.
One of the intellectual origins of this shift away from the traditional post-Depression approach came in September 1970, in an article written in the New York Times by Milton Friedman. It went under the title: ‘The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits’. If you will let me indulge, I am going to read the first paragraph.
‘When I hear businessmen speak eloquently about the social responsibilities of business in a free-enterprise system, I am reminded of the wonderful line about the Frenchman who discovered at the age of 70 that he had been speaking prose all his life. The businessmen believe that they are defending free en­terprise when they declaim that business is not concerned ‘merely’ with profit but also with promoting desirable ‘social’ ends; that business has a ‘social conscience’ and takes seriously its responsibilities for providing employment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution and whatever else may be the catchwords of the contemporary crop of reformers.
‘The discussions of the ‘social responsibilities of business’ are notable for their analytical looseness and lack of rigor’.
So, there you have it. The seeds of the financial crisis of 2008 were sown by Milton Friedman 38 years previously almost to the day. Well, not quite, because to my mind there is an even more interesting quote 3 paragraphs later, which I am also going to read.
‘In a free-enterprise, private-property system, a corporate executive is an employee of the owners of the business. He has direct responsibility to his employers. That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom’.
Friedman starts by setting out the essence of agency theory. People I know who know the piece tend to stop there. But let’s go on, because the interesting part for me is when he said that the responsibility to make as much money as possible should conform with the basic rules of society, as embodied in the law, and ‘in ethical custom’. Here to my mind we have the essence of the issue around culture.
There are ethical customs and laws that rightly constrain private interests. They are the representation of the public interest. And that public interest is not just the responsibility of public authorities like regulators; rather it is firstly the responsibility of firms, their managers and owners. The reality is, with the benefit of hindsight, that the point made by Friedman about ethical custom, and also the law, was not followed consistently, with disastrous consequences in the financial crisis. Since then, we have set about rebuilding the system and rebalancing the incentives.  I would also note that I think Friedman was wrong to suggest that ethical custom must always come in to firms from outside – from ‘society at large’. Firms are part of that society, as such they have public interest duties. I think this lack of connection between firms and societal duties in terms of the responsibilities of firms is where the culture debate and practice subsequently went wrong.
Public interest is not just the responsibility of public authorities like regulators; rather it is firstly the responsibility of firms, their managers and owners
Consistent with this wrong direction, there is little doubt in my mind that prior to the financial crisis, the culture towards the public interest and ethical custom were essentially permissive, to the point of anything goes. It was evident in the advocacy of light touch regulation, the view that left to themselves firms would succeed, and to paraphrase, just as a rising tide lifts all boats, so the public interest would benefit. It didn’t work out that way.
We are left then, I think, with the conclusion that the interpretation of the public interest and ethical customs has changed over time. But this also means that the interpretation can be influenced, which brings us back to the importance of work on culture.
Friedman’s insight was deeper than many interpretations have suggested, but open as we have seen to misinterpretation. Nevertheless, the proposition that the interpretation of what I will call an ethical culture serving the public interest can change over time, means that there is an important role for the incentives created by regulation and supervision of firms and their culture.
Developments of recent years
In our world, I would single out 2 developments of recent years as important for creating the incentives for good culture, namely the advent of the Senior Managers Regime for banks, which will shortly be implemented for other financial services firms and measures to govern the payment of remuneration to Senior Managers of banks.
It is important that regulatory measures such as the Senior Managers and remuneration regimes are rooted in clearly understood and applied basis principles and objectives. The basic principle of the Senior Managers Regime is that of responsibility and accountability. A senior manager has to take responsibility for the activities under their control. Likewise, they should be accountable for that responsibility. These concepts – responsibility and accountability – are disarmingly simple and direct. But such things tend to be the most powerful. I remember some years ago speaking at an event on the introduction of the Senior Managers Regime and being challenged that responsibility could not be defined and thus not enforced against either. We got into a debate, and then a lady in the audience put it more effectively than I had; she was teaching her children responsibility, and didn’t get what the problem my opponent in the debate had in understanding such a simple concept. Good culture rests on simple but powerful ideas was a lesson I took from that incident.
Another major cultural change post financial crisis has been the introduction of remuneration regulation for banks. As I noted earlier, the pre-financial crisis period was marked by strong growth in the remuneration of many bankers. But it wasn’t so much the level of remuneration that concerned us, but the incentives created by the structure of, particularly, variable remuneration, made up in good part by bonuses. You would imagine that the structure of variable remuneration would reflect the incentives to strong performance by the individual and their firm. When we looked at the pre-crisis period, sadly we often did not fund such incentives working. Rather, for instance, bonuses were awarded on the basis of the firm achieving higher levels of return in equity, which sounds ok until you realise that this is an incentive for higher leverage and weak capitalisation. Or, commission selling based pay was awarded with little scrutiny in the remuneration award process of just how the commission was being earned.
In the UK we have taken the approach towards regulating remuneration of creating so-called ‘skin in the game’. In other words putting a significant part of the variable remuneration at risk over coming years, which means using policies of requiring deferral for some period of time, and backing those policies up with others requiring so-called ‘malus’ and ‘clawback’.
Put simply, malus operates when the deferred but unvested remuneration is taken back by the firm as a consequence of some discovered misdemeanour or another problem subsequently discovered at the firm. Clawback is essentially the same, except that this involves taking back remuneration after it has been paid out.
In my view, over the last 10 years we have seen a major change in attitudes to, and the operation of, remuneration in banks. Early on, I was told quite often that deferral would not be accepted and would fail as a policy. I have not heard that refrain in recent years, which in itself illustrates that cultural values and attitudes of this sort do change quite quickly.
Interestingly, I think that deferral of vesting of remuneration achieves some of the incentive effects of the old partnership structure, in the sense that both create skin in the game. For partners, this meant leaving equity capital in the firm. This system died out as the major firms grew rapidly and needed to raise capital on a scale which went beyond the resources of partners.
For culture, the lessons I take from these examples are about the power of simple ideas, responsibility, commitment as represented by skin in the game, accountability. None of these big ideas is new, in fact quite the opposite. Nor do they require sophisticated tools to apply and monitor. They go with the grain of good incentives, and they act to support the public interest and its objectives. But, they do require effective and consistent implementation. This is where good governance comes in, a strong role for senior management and particularly boards. And, there is in regulated industries an important role for regulators to back up effective governance and very clearly espouse the public interest. It is interesting to reflect here that a decade ago, and this went on for a few years after the crisis, it was quite typical as a supervisor to be told by boards that very high levels of remuneration had to be paid whatever the state of the firm, for fear of losing key staff. I don’t hear that refrain today and haven’t done so for some years. That is a major and welcome cultural change in my view.
But, it would be at best incomplete to characterise the drivers of culture as being the activity of stopping bad things from happening, important though that is. As essays in our volume indicate, culture is about encouraging and incentivising good things, positive ethical customs to use Friedman’s phrase. It would not be a winning pitch for business to describe a culture as preventing the bad things that would otherwise inevitably happen. ‘No thanks’ should be the response. Nor should good culture just be about investigating when things go wrong.
Positive culture, as I will call it, goes right to the heart of what firms and their staff are, what values they represent and, the positive ethical customs
At the FCA, one of our fundamental principles for business is that firms should treat customers fairly, which is not the same as firms seeking to prevent the otherwise inevitable unfair treatment.
Positive culture, as I will call it, goes right to the heart of what firms and their staff are, what values they represent and the positive ethical customs.
It also requires that we all, and I include very much include bodies like the FCA in this, as regulator and employer, are prepared to pursue cultural change for the better, in our own world and as part of society more broadly. And, to be clear in the Friedman context, this is entirely consistent with observing the law and pursuing good ethical customs.
Good diversity at the workplace
I want to take one very prominent and topical example of good values and culture, namely pursuing and ensuring good diversity at the workplace. I always put forwards 2 arguments within my workplace for why this matters. First, I don’t want, as a matter of personal choice, to work in an environment which is not diverse. It would be dull, and it would be at risk of groupthink. We all need to be challenged, to avoid being set in our ways, and diversity plays an important part in achieving that. The second argument is that in order to properly understand and represent the public interest, we need as organisations – in the public and private sector – to bear a reasonably good resemblance to the society that we serve.
I would suggest that put like this, such arguments are pretty hard to refute.  But, of course, history tells us that we should take nothing for granted, and they have pretty shallow roots. This is another way of emphasising that culture and its values matters, and we should take good care to nurture it. Like most people, I was shocked by events at the Presidents Club. It was a wake-up call – I don’t take good cultural values for granted, don’t assume we live in a society where these things have changed everywhere.
But there is also a much deeper reason why diversity matters, and why it must be part of our culture, in workplaces and in society. That is because it represents the commitment to equal opportunities to all in society. It doesn’t matter what someone’s background is, what their gender, ethnicity, age, sexuality are. We welcome such diversity of background and character. I am very proud of the consistently strong scores at the FCA in our staff surveys for those questions which ask our staff to assess our performance as a tolerant and open workplace which espouses the public interest. We don’t always get universal acclaim for what we do, but our culture is one of always seeking to serve the public interest. That’s a big part of our culture.
A culture that pursues diversity and equal opportunities is I think one that will have much wider benefits for an organisation
One of the important issues in diversity and culture is the use of targets and measurement. I have to say that I have come round more to supporting measurement, targets and transparency as time has gone by, and now I am a fully paid up member.
Why? Predominantly, because I think that otherwise there just isn’t the same incentive to get things done and improve our state. So, we have adopted targets for gender and ethnicity, and we report our gender pay gap, as we should.
But I want to dwell for a moment on the argument that a culture which values and promotes diversity is one that favours equal opportunities in society. There is a deeper point here I think.
A culture that pursues diversity and equal opportunities is I think one that will have much wider benefits for an organisation. It suggests a culture that is open-minded, tolerant, aspiring to improve and considerate. When I look back at the cultures that I have seen where things have gone wrong, those are not descriptive terms that I would employ.
Conclusion
Let me have a go at pulling all of this together. Our Discussion Paper on transforming financial services culture is focused on 4 themes, namely: is there a ‘right’ culture in financial services; managing culture – the role of regulation; the role of reward, capabilities and environment in driving behaviours; and leading culture change. I will have a go – with due modesty I should emphasise – at suggesting some answers. There is no single ‘right’ culture. It depends on circumstances, and there are certainly cultural characteristics which are highly suggestive of good outcomes.
The role of regulation in culture is not to attempt sweeping rules, but rather to use rules and supervision to create the right incentives and to provide tools to diagnose the key characteristics. And, we can prompt and persuade. 
On the role of reward, as I have discussed it is another influence to create the right incentives for good culture. 
And, finally, on leadership, there is no question in my mind that it plays a crucial role in shaping culture. 
I can safely predict that the issue of culture and its role in the conduct of firms will run and run, as it should, because it should not stand still.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority
Regulating innovation: a global enterprise,Speeches,19/03/2018,20/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/regulating-innovation-global-enterprise,"Speaker: Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy and CompetitionLocation: Innovate Finance 2018, The Guildhall, LondonDelivered on: 19 March 2018
Highlights:
Collaboration with international colleagues has been a core part of the FCA’s FinTech story since we launched Project Innovate in 2014.
Our regulatory sandbox is supporting firms in reducing the time and cost of getting innovative ideas to market.
We’re increasingly hearing a demand from firms to operate internationally, so we’re working with partners from around the world to consider options for a global sandbox.
The potential of such a project is huge – from solving global problems like money laundering to reducing the regulatory burden of compliance.
Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from delivered version.
FinTech is one of those industries that we can genuinely call a global community. The international dimension of FinTech is inextricable from its success as a sector. And for the FCA as a regulator, the degree to which we seek to work with international colleagues is a defining feature of our work in this space.
In previous years, I’ve had the opportunity to talk here about our innovation work and the launch of our regulatory sandbox. We have worked with over 500 firms through FCA Innovate and around 70 in depth in our sandbox. This has been one of the largest and most complex regulatory sandboxes in the world, involving firms from Singapore, the US and South Africa, amongst other countries. So, as we look to the next stage of our innovation journey, it is only natural that international cooperation should be a key part of the picture. 
Today I’d like to talk about this vision and the role that the FCA will play in it.
Future innovation
As many here will know, our innovation story began in 2014 with the launch of Project Innovate. The purpose of Innovate was and remains to help firms tackle regulatory barriers to innovation, be it through clarifying regulatory expectations, examining our own rules or enacting policy changes, to give them space to innovate in the interest of consumers.
We found that the risk of not opening up markets to innovation was bigger than the risk of taking that leap.
Central to this is our regulatory sandbox, a ‘safe space’ where businesses can test innovative products, services, business models and delivery mechanisms in the real market, with real consumers.
We were the first regulator to attempt a project of this type. And in order to make it work we had to change perceptions about the role of the regulator – for both firms and ourselves. We had a big job to do to ensure firms found us easy to work with and knowledgeable about the challenges they face in bringing new products to market.
The shift in mindset that was required was significant too: from the traditional regulator’s standpoint of ‘what is the risk?’ to asking ‘what is the risk of not doing this?’ And when we asked ourselves that question we found that the risk of not opening up markets to innovation was bigger than the risk of taking that leap.
The sandbox has been as much an experiment for us as it is for the firms themselves. But, I have to say, for a calculated risk, this bet has really paid off. Since we launched the sandbox in 2016 we have supported firms in reducing the time and cost of getting innovative ideas to market. In fact, 90% of firms from our first round of applications have gone on to market, with many firms finding it easier to get funding as a result of participating in the sandbox.
We’ve seen take-up by large firms as well as start-ups, who may not have had the confidence to try new approaches without the security of the sandbox. And through sandbox firms being closely supervised in their test phase we’ve learnt an enormous amount about how new technologies are being applied.
So we know this approach is working. The question is, is it enough? Over the last couple of years, we’ve seen a trend emerge which has become impossible to ignore. Increasingly we’re hearing from firms a demand to operate globally, to grow at real scale and pace. This would involve working with other regulators across the globe to conduct tests at the same time.
Our whole history with Innovate has been about doing things that regulators historically haven’t done.
Through the sandbox we’ve seen 30 applications from international firms and have gone on to support 11 of them – many of which are also in other countries’ innovation programmes. It’s clear which way the wind is blowing.
Nor is international collaboration around FinTech new to us. Over the last few years, we’ve signed ten cooperation agreements with eight different jurisdictions, allowing us to share market trends, collaborate on projects and refer innovative firms across markets.
But currently there is no joint sandbox programme with other regulators for firms to participate in. Such a project represents new territory. Breaking new ground requires an element of risk, not something, as I’ve said, that regulators are generally comfortable with. But our whole history with Innovate has been about doing things that regulators historically haven’t done.
To face those risks, we have to ensure we have the right controls, all the while bearing in mind the risk of not acting. So we’re up for the challenge.
Naturally, though, we want to do our homework. That’s why last month we invited stakeholders to share their views on what a global sandbox could look like. The responses – from regulators to start-ups, challengers to large firms, trade bodies to think tanks – make for fascinating reading.
As expected, there is lots of interest in the idea of cross-border testing; in the benefits this could bring, such as reducing cost and complexity, and accelerating expansion into other jurisdictions – especially for smaller firms who are keen to expand internationally.
In terms of the jurisdictions that respondents are keen to see included, the US featured high up the list. South America, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Europe also made an appearance. African countries, like South Africa and Kenya, also featured in a number of responses. This should come as no surprise when you consider how new models of banking have grown up there.
When it came to how a global sandbox might work in practice we saw some really creative suggestions coming through – from a ‘global dictionary’ which covers data needs across different countries to a joint mission statement from participating regulators with agreed criteria and consumer safeguards.
And overseeing it all, it was suggested, could be a ‘college of regulators’ – a consortium of representatives from participating regulators, something that corresponds with our own thinking.
So, what do we think?
We should be practical. Establishing a global sandbox is an immense undertaking and we have to be realistic about the task at hand. In some quarters, there could be an aspiration for global standards. The logic is clearly there, but my strong suspicion is that it would take twenty years to negotiate and in a fast-moving market would be nineteen years and six months out of date when we got there.
We should work with and through international bodies where we can – we are already working closely with international colleagues in IOSCO, for example. To avoid running before we can walk, we might want to start with those jurisdictions which already have established sandboxes or innovation hubs.
The model should allow some room for us to experiment with what works. So we could see a range of sandbox tests. For example, a single test in one country collecting data for multiple interested regulators. Or simultaneous testing in more than one country. 
The membership should be flexible. We should not assume that all regulators would be engaged in every test, although we should, of course, share knowledge and learning widely. 
Most of all - the key to all of this is collaboration – this has to be a joint effort across international regulators, not a UK global sandbox.
Collaboration will run through the next chapter of the UK’s FinTech story like a stick of rock
Because, clearly, we can’t do this alone. While we may be the ones kicking off the discussion, we won’t have much success if we’re just talking to ourselves. So now is the time to bring fellow regulators around the world into the conversation. In fact, collaboration will run through the next chapter of the UK’s FinTech story like a stick of rock.
Later this week we start work with interested regulators, including colleagues across Europe, the US and Far East, on a blueprint. So there’s real momentum behind this and we hope that before long the ambition of a global sandbox will be a reality.
Global problems and solutions
Now, participating in a global sandbox would represent a truly momentous step forward in the UK’s FinTech journey. But we think it could do a lot more than just allow innovators to test their ideas. One option we want to explore is the power of this sandbox to solve global problems.
In my conversations with colleagues I hear them grappling with many of the same challenges as us, whether they’re from Sydney or Singapore. Can we use the global sandbox to tackle the questions occupying the minds of the international community, questions which have potentially huge ramifications for financial services and beyond?
I want to give two examples.
First, the anti-money laundering effort – after all, controls can’t be effective if there’s fragmentation. This is an area where we all have skin in the game.
The UN estimates the full global scale of money laundering to be $1.6 trillion annually. It’s in all our interests to apply our joint expertise globally in tackling it. That’s why, in May, we will be bringing together international partners from the US, Europe, Australia, Japan and Korea in a TechSprint which will focus specifically on developing solutions to the challenges of money laundering, financial crime and terrorist financing. This will be the fifth TechSprint we’ve held.
These events draw on the skills of software developers, data scientists and subject matter experts. We work together in cross-industry groups to develop real, tangible solutions to critical problems in financial services. And they create real results. From previous techsprints we’ve seen commercial partnerships established between and several large banks will take regulatory reporting into a production environment.
Our ambition for the AML event is that it serves as a first step in establishing a deep international dialogue around the role of technology in tackling money laundering and criminal finance.
So we see each TechSprint as a real catalyst for change, not just a talking shop.
Computer says yes
For my second example I want to move from the economic and criminal burden of money laundering, to the regulatory burden of compliance. This, the accuracy of regulatory reporting, and the resource and time taken to achieve it, is another field where our paths cross with those of international regulators.
Monitoring misconduct can be like trying to find a needle in a haystack – no matter which jurisdiction you’re operating in. But the advances of the last few years have opened up a whole new world of possibilities, which could see the regulatory burden become more effective and the costs shrink considerably.
One area where this could be applied to great effect is around the way firms interpret our regulatory requirements. What if, requirements could be expressed in a language that could be understood by machines? Not for everything, but for many reporting requirements. We know that the technology exists.
At our TechSprint on regulatory reporting last year, we saw for ourselves that it is possible to take a regulatory requirement contained in our handbook and turn it into a language that a machine can understand. And from that language, machines can respond to the requirement by effectively pulling the necessary information direct from the firm. Not in months, but in seconds. In our sprint, 12 seconds to be precise.
The potential benefits of this are huge. If regulatory requirements can be executed by machines, a firm’s compliance with that obligation will be more consistent, meaning we receive more timely, better quality data. It also means that firms’ implementation of our rules would be faster and more efficient, significantly reducing costs but without diminishing the benefits for markets or consumers.
We can’t get ahead of ourselves here. What we tested end to end at the TechSprint was a very narrow example of this and we can’t flick a switch and suddenly have a regulatory regime which is entirely based on machine executable rules.
But what we are exploring, is could we implement a new requirement using this method. We will be conducting further research on this over the next few months and hope to start to be able to put this into practice beyond that.
Conclusion
Three and half years after we launched Project Innovate and our belief in the transformative role of technology in improving outcomes for consumers has not wavered. In fact, our ambitions are greater than ever before. The opportunities are there for the taking – and we are poised to reach out and grab them with both hands. But we can’t do it alone.
Finance is a truly global sector and it only makes sense that we tackle the challenges of our age together. So fostering innovation and collaboration will be absolutely central to what we do next. And we hope you’ll join us on the next stage of the journey.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Motor Finance – update,News stories,15/03/2018,01/10/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/motor-finance-update,"In July 2017, we set out our plans to put the spotlight on motor finance and highlighted the key questions we wanted to answer. We have a range of work underway to build a stronger understanding of this market and how consumers engage with motor finance firms, from carrying out detailed analysis of millions of credit files to a mystery shopping exercise. 
Our main findings from the work done so far are that:
growth in motor finance has been strongest for consumers with better credit ratings, who are less likely to face repayment difficulties
arrears and default rates remain generally low, though they have increased moderately in recent years
arrears and default rates are higher, and have risen more, amongst customers with the lowest credit ratings, who account for around 3% of lending
if not properly managed, some of the commission arrangements in place could incentivise dealers to arrange more expensive finance for customers
in some cases, customers are not being provided with key information in an accessible manner, including information provided on lenders’ and dealers’ websites
the largest lenders are adequately managing the risk of a severe fall in prices for used cars, but firms should regularly consider relevant changes in the market.
We are focusing on particular areas of concern for the remainder of our review:
whether firms are properly assessing whether customers can afford to buy the car they are being offered – particularly for people with lower credit scores
how firms are managing the risks around commission arrangements for dealers
whether consumers’ engagement with firms, and the information they are given, allows them to make informed decisions.
We will set out our findings and plans to tackle any areas of concern by the end of 2018.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Introduction: Jonathan Davidson, Director of Supervision - Retail and Authorisations
Consumer credit regulation
We took over responsibility for regulating consumer credit 4 years ago, in April 2014. We are responsible for over 30,000 consumer credit firms, a market that continues to grow and to innovate. We – and firms across the sector – have delivered major improvements in that time.
We introduced robust authorisation and supervision to drive up standards across the industry, and particularly in areas where consumers were being very poorly treated – damaging the reputation of the whole sector. 
Where we see harm to consumers, we act to address the issues. Our approach is to do this without restricting consumers’ access or freedom to choose products that work well for them. Last month, we brought in new rules on credit cards that will save billions of pounds for millions of customers. This morning we published an update on progress of our work on motor finance. Our update sets out how the market is operating today. We have been clear on which areas are not a concern and which areas require further attention.
This afternoon (15 March 2018), I’m looking forward to speaking to credit firms at the Credit Summit conference. I’m keen to discuss how firms can think strategically about serving customers better, and make themselves and their industry more sustainable in the process.  My speech will be available for you to read on our website, fca.org.uk.

Hot topics
Transforming culture in financial services
We have published a discussion paper on transforming culture in financial services. The paper gathers opinions from thought leaders, including financial services leaders, academics and change practitioners. It is intended to stimulate further debate on what else needs to be done to drive culture change.
Culture in financial services is widely accepted as a key root cause of the major conduct failings that occurred within the industry in recent history. Given its impact, firms’ culture is a priority for the FCA. Firms should foster cultures which support the spirit of regulation in stopping harm to consumers and markets.
We recognise that each firm’s culture is different and we don’t prescribe what it should be. However, we have introduced minimum standards of behaviour through our Conduct Rules and regulatory interventions. The introduction of a Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR) is an example of this work. It aims to reduce harm to consumers and strengthen market integrity by making individuals more accountable for their conduct and competence. The SM&CR is already in place in the banking sector but we’re extending it to cover insurers and solo-regulated firms.  
We are not requesting formal feedback on this paper. However, we want those with an interest in financial services to think about the issues in the paper and take part in the debate about what constitutes a healthy culture and how to promote it.
EU Withdrawal
On 9 March, we launched a short online survey to EEA firms and fund managers passporting into the UK. The survey will identify firms for which a temporary permission may be relevant and help to inform communications with them.
Last December, the UK Government announced that if necessary it will legislate to provide the UK’s regulators with powers to grant EEA firms and funds passporting into the UK a temporary permission. EEA firms and funds which receive a temporary permission would be able to enter into new contracts and fulfil existing contracts with UK customers for a period of time after exit day, while seeking full authorisation in the UK.   
We set out initial details of how we intend to use the scheme on 20 December. The survey will contribute to the overall design of the scheme. It will also allow us to communicate directly with interested firms about the scheme and authorisation process.

Changes to the SONIA benchmark on 23 April 2018
The date and time of the publication of the SONIA benchmark is changing on Monday 23 April 2018. This was confirmed by the Bank of England in a News Release of 16 October 2017.
Friday 20 April 2018 will be the final day for which SONIA will be calculated and published by the WMBA using the current methodology. For the rate relating to Monday 23 April, SONIA will be calculated by the Bank using the reformed methodology and published at 9am on Tuesday 24 April; no data will be published on Monday 23 April.
More information about the SONIA reforms is available in the SONIA Key features and policies document on the Bank’s website. 
Web page update: Mortgage Lending Statistics (MLAR): Q4 2017 data
We have, alongside the Bank of England, published the latest Mortgage Lenders and Administrators Statistics covering the period up to the end of Q4 2017. We produce the joint Statistics on Mortgage Lending to maintain a complete picture of the regulated mortgage sector.
Retail banking: product governance review 
Our supervision of small and medium retail banks has found some good practice in product governance.  This can help banks improve the way they assess and incorporate customer needs at every stage, from product design to post-sale service and product removal.
We looked at how firms managed their products over time and what frameworks they have in place to identify and mitigate conduct risks.  We found that to achieve good customer outcomes, it is important firms consider that customer needs change over time.  So firms must ensure they consider the potential risks to customers, and ways to mitigate these, throughout a product’s lifecycle.
We give a more detailed update for firms on our website.
Payment Accounts Regulations
The Payment Accounts Regulations require the FCA to gather certain data (on basic bank accounts and switching) from payment service providers (PSPs) that offer payment accounts. This covers the period between 18 September 2016 and 28 February 2018 and must be reported to us by 30 April 2018.
We will shortly contact PSPs that, based on their permissions, could offer payment accounts, with a form for them to provide the information to us.
PSPs must determine themselves whether they provide payment accounts. Our website has guidance on the definition of a payment account.
If your firm offers payment accounts and we have not contacted you, or you have any other queries, please email [email protected].

Dear CEO: Second charge lenders
We recently undertook a review of how second charge lenders have adapted to the responsible lending requirements contained in Chapter 11 of the Mortgage Conduct of Business (MCOB) sourcebook. Our findings led us to issue a Dear CEO letter to firms we believe are active in this market, based on the information provided to us in regulatory returns. This letter sets out what we found and action firms should take.
Any firm that hasn’t received this letter and considers themselves to either be active in the second charge lending market or plan to be should review the letter and take appropriate action. We are aware that a number of lenders have second charge loan books but are not actively lending. They may also find this letter of interest.

General Insurance Intermediaries and Insurers
Update on Alpha Insurance and CBL Insurance Europe
Alpha Insurance A/S ('Alpha') is an insurance firm authorised and regulated by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority. CBL Insurance Europe dac (CBLIE) is an insurance firm authorised and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. They both operate in the UK on a freedom of services basis.
The Danish FSA informed the FCA on 4 March 2018 that Alpha has been placed into solvent liquidation. It has been instructed to cease writing new business with immediate effect. Alpha continues to otherwise operate normally and existing policies continue to remain in force. Any existing Alpha Insurance policyholders who have concerns about their policy should contact the firm directly, or their broker (if the policy was bought through a broker).  
The Central Bank of Ireland informed the FCA that it has made an application on 2 March 2018 to the High Court to have a provisional administrator appointed to CBLIE, to protect its policyholders. Existing policies continue to remain in force. The Central Bank of Ireland is recommending that policyholders contact the firm directly, or their broker (if the policy was bought through a broker) to arrange alternative cover as soon as possible.
Brokers who have clients insured with these firms should review whether their cover is still appropriate in the circumstances.
FCA Live & Local regional programme continues
We have added a presentation for retail insurers and intermediaries on 14 May at our London office. Topics include governance, cyber resilience, fair treatment of customers and regulatory changes.                       
In the next few months, we are continuing our well-received series of interactive workshops on how firms can identify and prevent harm with sessions in Bournemouth, Gloucestershire and Norwich. Our next interactive Q&A roundtable discussion is taking place in Glasgow on 3 May where we will be joined by the Association of Professional Compliance Consultants (APCC) on the panel.
Dates, locations and registration details for upcoming events are on the Live & Local webpage.
To be notified of future Live & Local regional events, sign up to email alerts using our Live & Local updates web form.
EU withdrawal survey
In December 2017, the UK Government announced that if necessary it will legislate to provide a temporary permission scheme for EEA firms and funds passporting into the UK. EEA firms and funds which receive a temporary permission would be able to enter into new business and fulfil existing contracts with UK customers for a period of time after exit day, while seeking full authorisation in the UK.
Firms that would be solo-regulated in the UK by the FCA would need to notify us before the UK exits the European Union of their desire to benefit from the regime. We are asking firms to complete a short survey to the overall design of the scheme as well as enabling us to communicate directly with interested firms about the scheme and authorisation process.

Life insurance & Pension Providers
Webinar: effective competition in non-workplace pensions
We are hosting a webinar on non-workplace pensions on 22 March at 14.30-15.30. It replaces the event originally planned for 2 March.
It follows our discussion paper on this topic, launched in February, which aims to understand whether competition is working well in the market for non-workplace pensions and whether there is a need to go further to protect consumers.
The webinar will feature Brian Corr (Head of Department, Retail Competition) and Chris Curry of the Pensions Policy Institute, and will include an opportunity to ask questions of the speakers.
You can sign up for the webinar. If you can’t make the webinar, we welcome written responses to the discussion paper before the 27 April.
Events: pensions strategy seminars in Edinburgh and Manchester
As part of our efforts to make sure the pensions sector works well for consumers and workplace pension savers, The FCA and The Pensions Regulator (TPR) are working together to develop a joint pensions strategy. This will look at how we will work together, and with stakeholders, in the coming years.
We want to offer all interested parties the opportunity to contribute to our thinking as we develop our joint strategy.  So, we will publish an accompanying document, seeking feedback on our description of the pensions landscape, our respective regulatory remits and our key areas of focus. 
We will also hold a series of events for stakeholders this Spring. We still have places available in Edinburgh on 28 March and Manchester on 12 April.
For more information and to register please visit the event website.

Dear CEO: Second charge lenders
We recently undertook a review of how second charge lenders have adapted to the responsible lending requirements contained in Chapter 11 of the Mortgage Conduct of Business (MCOB) sourcebook. Our findings led us to issue a Dear CEO letter to firms we believe are active in this market, based on the information provided to us in regulatory returns. This letter sets out what we found and action firms should take.
Any firm that hasn’t received this letter and considers themselves to either be active in the second charge lending market or plan to be should review the letter and take appropriate action. We are aware that a number of lenders have second charge loan books but are not actively lending. They may also find this letter of interest.
Credit Cards – Rules and Guidance
We are introducing new rules for credit card firms to reduce expensive long-term borrowing. These rules are expected to save billions of pounds for millions of customers – we expect customer savings to peak at between £310m and £1.3bn a year in lower interest charges. They will come into effect in 6 months’ time.
The new rules follow our comprehensive 2 year study of the credit card market, in which we analysed 34 million credit card customers’ accounts over 5 years and surveyed nearly 40,000 consumers.
Motor Finance
We have published an update on our review of motor finance. It sets out our findings so far and the areas of concern we will focus on for the remainder of the review. We will complete the review and publish proposals for action on remaining areas of concern in September.

Northern Ireland Credit Unions and Industrial and Provident Societies Transfer
From 6 April, the FCA will be the registering authority for Northern Ireland Credit Unions and Industrial and Provident Societies (IPSs). Credit Unions and IPSs are currently registered by the Northern Ireland Department for Economy (DfE), though Credit Unions are already regulated by us (and the PRA).
Fees for credit unions will not change as a result of the transfer. IPSs will be charged according to our existing fee structure. Northern Ireland credit unions and IPSs do not need to take any action immediately. From 6 April you will need to send to us anything you would have previously sent to DfE eg applications to change your rules. Visit the FCA website for more information.

CRR article 493(4-7) permission - Transitional arrangement for exemption from certain large exposures limits
The Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) has been updated by article 1(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2395 which incorporates the new paragraphs 4 to 7 in article 493 of the CRR. It now provides for a transitional arrangement for the exemption from large exposure limits available to exposures to certain public sector debt of Member States denominated in the domestic currencies of any Member States. The transitional period will be 3 years starting from 1 January 2018 for exposures of this type incurred on or after 12 December 2017.
IFPRU investment firms may apply for a permission under CRR article 493(4-7). Subject to our discretion, this permission would allow IFPRU investment firms to incur any of the exposures provided for in the new paragraph 5 of CRR article 493 meeting the conditions set out in paragraph 6, up to the following limits:
100% of the institution's Tier 1 capital until 31 December 2018
75% of the institution's Tier 1 capital until 31 December 2019
50% of the institution's Tier 1 capital until 31 December 2020
See how to apply for a capital requirements permission.

Outlining the FCA’s approach to authorisation,Speeches,15/03/2018,15/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/outlining-fca-approach-authorisation,"Speaker: Sarah Rapson, Director, AuthorisationsEvent: APCC Annual ConferenceDelivered: 14 March 2018Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version
Highlights
We use authorisation primarily to prevent harm and we use it in a proportionate manner.
We use authorisation to improve conduct standards and culture in firms.
We do not operate a zero-failure regime.
My subject today is our approach to authorisation, on which we have just consulted. We are now analysing responses, so it’s too early to give feedback, but I would like to thank APCC for your response and assure you that we will consider carefully what you have said. Later this year, we will publish the final paper and I’d be happy to come back and talk about it then, if you would find that useful.
Today I will focus on three things that link directly to the questions on which we consulted:
How we use authorisation to deliver the FCA Mission.
How we help firms to meet our minimum standards.
How we are improving our approach and being more transparent about our performance.
On this last point, we have a major change programme underway that is already delivering benefits, with more to come. I will talk about how it is improving the authorisation process for your clients, whilst maintaining our underpinning regulatory requirements.
I am sure that you are familiar with the FCA’s Mission, so I do not propose to discuss that in detail. I shall, however, highlight three points about our approach to authorisation that can be overlooked or misunderstood.
The first is that we use authorisation primarily to prevent harm and we use it in a proportionate manner. In practice, the information that we require from firms, and the scrutiny we give to applications, are linked inextricably to our assessment of the risk of harm, mainly to consumers. These will vary, according to that assessment.
The second is that we also use authorisation to improve conduct standards and culture in firms. We test the most significant factors that can create harmful cultures within firms’ business models and their conduct.
The third is that we do not operate a zero-failure regime. To prevent all firm failure or harm to consumers would be unachievable; it would also be undesirable as it would stifle innovation and competition.
Some people think there is a trade-off between competition and consumer protection. I disagree - competition and innovation are essential.
Some people think there is a trade-off between competition and consumer protection. I disagree - competition and innovation are essential. Inevitably, however, some firms will fail. When this happens we aim to ensure that firms exit the market in an orderly way that mitigates potential harm to consumers and the market. We also recognise that firms with new and innovative business models won’t necessarily understand what it means to be regulated. We aim to support them to understand and to meet our minimum standards.
These minimum standards are crucial. Firms that wish to provide regulated financial services and relevant individuals in those firms must meet common sets of minimum standards – known as Threshold Conditions for firms and the Fit and Proper Test for individuals. Importantly, they must continue to meet the standards for as long as they are authorised. Ensuring this is primarily the responsibility of my supervisory colleagues at the FCA and, for certain firms, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). The FCA will soon consult on its approach to supervision.
In our experience, most applications are quite straightforward. But some are complicated, sometimes needlessly so. This may be because some firms don’t understand the Threshold Conditions. We consulted on this and asked what more we could do to explain them and the purpose behind each one.
With that in mind, it is important that we set out clearly our expectations before firms begin the authorisation process. We also need to consider how we, the FCA, and you and your clients can avoid pitfalls that cause delay or even lead to refusal or rejection of applications.
For our part, we will do as much as we reasonably can to support firms to become authorised, while never lowering the minimum standards that we expect them to meet. We look to you to understand our approach to authorisation and the minimum standards they must meet, and to advise your clients accordingly. Before I finish, I will set out some common pitfalls and how these can best be avoided.
Authorisation as a remedy to prevent harm
In the Mission we describe the FCA’s decision-making framework that guides how we use our resources, including which tools we will use, to prevent harm or put things right when they go wrong.
Within this framework, authorisation is a remedial tool that we use to prevent harm by ensuring that firms and individuals meet the minimum standards. This is not as strange as it may seem. Typically we think of remedies as being required to fix problems that have occurred; but they can also prevent them. To understand this is to understand much about our approach to authorisation and to helping your clients get the desired outcome.
I have said that we aim to be proportionate in the information that we require from firms and in our scrutiny of their applications. We do not operate a ‘one size fits all’ model. On the contrary, we are guided by the principles of good regulation, recognising differences in the businesses of firms that wish to be authorised. Essentially our approach is determined by the risk of harm that we believe a firm poses.
Conduct and culture in firms
Let me now turn to how we use authorisation to improve conduct and culture in firms, which is created by typical patterns of behaviour and ways of thinking that are reinforced over time. We test the most significant factors that can create harmful cultures, including a firm’s purpose, its leadership, its approach to rewarding and managing people, and its governance arrangements, including where the ‘mind’ of a firm is located.
The actions of individuals define a firm’s culture. In the wake of the financial crisis and subsequent significant conduct failings, such as the manipulation of the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), there has been a greater emphasis from government on the need for personal accountability. This led to the creation of the Senior Manager and Certification Regime, which aims to reduce consumer harm and strengthen market integrity by making individuals more personally accountable for their conduct and competence.
The regime is being extended to include all regulated financial services firms and will replace the current Approved Persons Regime. It will, therefore, have an impact on your clients. My colleagues will speak about this later, so I shall not steal their thunder. I simply observe that it will change significantly the current regime under which we approve individuals, for example by requiring senior managers to have clear statements of responsibility.
Competition and innovation
Authorisation is not only a preventative tool, keeping the gate shut to firms and individuals who do not meet the minimum standards. As I noted earlier, we use it also to promote competition and innovation - in other words to open the gate.
Regulation can be complex and hard for firms to understand. It has not always kept up with innovation, with some firms operating business models that could not have been foreseen when the rules were made. I don’t think anyone should be too surprised at this and, of course, it’s not a challenge limited to the financial services sector. But I recognise that regulatory uncertainty or complexity in the authorisations process can be a problem for firms.
These challenges can pose an even greater barrier for firms that are new to the market, innovative - or both. So, we have a range of initiatives we use to support firms to understand and meet the minimum standards. We give pre-application support to innovative firms. We enable them to test new products or services in a safe environment. We support and encourage new entry into retail banking. We offer specialist help to asset management firms. We give feedback to firms wishing to offer automated advice.
We also recognise that firms in the start-up phase may find it difficult to meet some minimum standards for authorisation, such as having appropriate financial resources. Some firms, for example, may only be able to attract the required investment once we have authorised them. We will consider these situations carefully and may decide to authorise a firm ‘subject to’ a restriction, limitation or requirement that it must meet from the point of authorisation. This could include, for example, limiting a firm’s ability to operate by restricting the number of customers it can take on until it has met certain conditions.
Depending on the size, complexity and needs of the firm, and our available resource, support can range from a phone call to clarify how our rules apply to a specific business model, to on-going support to help an innovative start-up prepare for authorisation. It may include helping firms understand the rules, or supporting them as they shape their business models in more detail.
We are considering how to ‘industrialise’ these approaches. In the consultation, we invited comment on how we can improve this support for firms.
This support is over and above the public commitments that we outline in the consultation, which are more concerned with what firms may expect from us during the application process. But let me reassure you that we are not trying to steal the food from your plates. While we do give firms as much assistance as is reasonable, there are limits to what we should and can do. The FCA does not provide consultancy advice.
Becoming supervised
You understand that demonstrating a firm meets the minimum standards, and will continue to meet them, is not a simple box-ticking exercise. Becoming authorised is not like passing an exam. The firm cannot put the books away and forget everything it learned along the way. It must maintain the minimum standards for as long as it is regulated. We recognise that becoming supervised by the FCA is a significant step; as part of improving our service focus, we will support firms more consistently as they enter the system of supervision, providing appropriate levels of help and guidance to navigate the process.
Using digital technology and data
It should be no surprise that we also intend to deploy digital technology and data to their greatest effect. External manifestations of this include improving the clarity of the authorisation pages of  our site, making the handbook easier to navigate and improving the Financial Services Register.
Linked to the better use of data are improvements to how we measure and report our performance. Following consultation, in December we published a more comprehensive and, in my view, more useful set of performance indicators covering the second quarter of this financial year. Consistently and across all types of application we show the numbers of applications received, determined and on-hand, and the minimum, maximum, mean and modal times for case determination.
We also show our performance in terms of the cases that should have been decided in the period. For example, we decided 99% of cases within statutory deadlines that fell due during the second quarter of the year. The average for determining new authorisation applications was under 13 weeks. For straightforward, very low risk consumer credit cases, the average was under one week. Publishing these data means that you can track whether or not we are meeting our commitment to improve service and call us out on it if we don’t.
But we will, of course.
Common pitfalls
Now, I said earlier that I would set out some of the common pitfalls that we see firms encounter. I’m sure you have examples of applications that did not go to plan. Situations like this are in no-one’s interest. So how can we avoid them?
For our part, we need to act, and be seen to act, in a proportionate, predictable and consistent manner. We need to give appropriate levels of support to firms. And we must ensure that we communicate our concerns and expectations clearly. The key for firms and their advisors is to understand the rationale behind our approach to authorisation, hence our consultation. Firms must take note of those concerns and rectify the problems.
Some examples of pitfalls into which firms can fall:
Sometimes firms fail to provide information we request, or they provide the wrong information, or overcomplicate their responses. This could be because they do not understand our concerns or the questions we ask or why we ask them. If in doubt, they should ask us.
Similarly, firms can misunderstand what is required of them, especially where there is new regulation, such as PSD2 or MiFID2. Again, they should speak with us if they are uncertain as to our requirements.
From time to time we deal with firms that will not engage with us or do so reluctantly; or they address our concerns in part but not fully. In such circumstances we may well conclude that a firm is not ready to be authorised and could not be supervised effectively. My message is simple; firms need to cooperate with us.
Sometimes firms apply for authorisation prematurely, before they are ready to demonstrate that they meet the minimum conditions; at very least this will delay our consideration of their applications, especially if they also fail to provide the information that we require. Firms should apply when they are ready, not to secure their place in the queue.
Those are just a few examples. But the common theme is that firms that understand what we are trying to achieve through having a rigorous approach to authorisations and why, are more likely to be successful in their applications.
Our ambition is to continue to improve our approach to authorisation, ensuring that we use it to deliver maximum public value. We will continue to take a proportionate approach to preventing harm. We will continue to use authorisation to help improve conduct, culture and governance in firms. We will continue to be imaginative in our use of authorisation to promote competition and innovation.

Firms will find it straightforward to engage with us. We will be clear about our expectations of them. They will know what to expect from us and we will deliver consistently, for example in terms of our set of public commitments to them.

Getting affordability right in consumer credit,Speeches,15/03/2018,15/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/getting-affordability-right-consumer-credit,"Speaker: Jonathan Davidson, Director of Supervision - Retail and AuthorisationsLocation:Credit Summit, LondonDelivered on: 15 March 2018
Note: This is the text of the speech as drafted, which may differ from the delivered version.
Highlights
A firm whose business model is predicated on selling products to customers who can’t afford to repay them is not acceptable, nor is it a sustainable long-term strategy.
The financial situation for some is precarious, which means firms not only need to consider whether a customer has a history of repaying, but whether they are likely to be able to do so in the future.
A successful business model relies on having a healthy firm culture.
Thank you for inviting me today to speak. The consumer credit sector is by far and away our largest sector in terms of number of firms with almost 40,000 firms registered with the FCA. And as a sector you have been growing – according to the Bank of England, consumer credit grew 9.3% over the last year.
This growth has been attracting a lot of attention. Which is not surprising given the link between excessive debt and the last financial crisis. Credit losses led to the near collapse of many lenders. Of course, we know it is vitally important to ensure that you as lenders are prudentially sound because you provide a key service to retail consumers and businesses. And when I say we, I mean the PRA and the FCA, because the FCA oversees the vast majority of firms in the consumer credit sector for prudential purposes.
The good news is that my overall sense is that the sector has not reached levels of debt which are likely harmful to you as lenders. And we have looked at some of the key markets including credit card and car finance markets, more on which later. We have also seen progress by your sector in addressing conduct issues – you are aware of a number of high-profile redress schemes.
So today, I want to speak less about you and more about your customers. You, the consumer credit sector, serve around 39 million people. We use your services extensively whether it is to borrow to finance a car, a computer, a sofa, to make ends meet towards the end of the month or to tide us over an unexpected and temporary drop in income. You are part of everyday life for most of us and by and large you do a good job for us, your customers.
But we also need to recognise that excessive debt can be as harmful to the borrower as it is to the lender.
After all, none of us can forget the context in which we are operating. Total credit lending to individuals is currently very close to its September 2008 peak. The circumstances are different now than 10 years ago, but there are still worrying numbers of householders who may still be in too deep. For example, 1 in 5 mortgages today are interest only mortgages, many of which were made at the height of the credit boom to borrowers with little equity in their homes and not a lot of disposable income. And they won’t mature until about 2032.
We also know that there are a number of customers out there who are vulnerable to any changes in their circumstances, and to changes to the external economic environment. They might be able to just about afford any loans you grant them today, but it is far from certain that they will be able to do so in the future.
A business model that is predicated on selling products to customers who can’t afford to repay them is not acceptable.
A business model that is predicated on selling products to customers who can’t afford to repay them is not acceptable. We will take action against firms who run their businesses this way. The £14.8 million paid out by BrightHouse last year shows how seriously we take this. And it’s not just unacceptable, it is unsustainable – the reputation damage of running a business of this kind will see confidence, and customers, drain away.
Having a healthy, sustainable business is what I want to focus my talk on today. I think there is more we can do together to consider marginal consumers, and to act now to pre-empt future harm. I want you as an industry to think strategically about the issues facing your customers. This is the right thing to do, not only for your customers, but for the future of your businesses. After all, thinking strategically about consumers leads to better innovation and greater sustainability.
I will raise three questions in my talk today:
1. What are the warning signs of future problems that you might want to think about as an industry?
2. What are the key issues we are still seeing in relation to creditworthiness and affordability?
3. How can firms pre-empt issues by fostering a healthy, sustainable business model and culture?
Warning signs
Most borrowers can still comfortably afford their credit. But it’s most – not all. The Bank of England’s Financial Stability Report last year noted that consumer credit has grown rapidly and that, relative to incomes, household debt is high. And there are a significant number of households that are in so deep that the slightest sign of rough weather could see them in over their heads.
This can be seen, for instance, in the motor finance sector. This morning we published an update on the motor finance sector, which has grown rapidly: for example, the number of motor finance agreements for new and used cars has grown from around 1.2m in 2008 to around 2.3m in 2017.
The good news is that most of this growth has been to lower credit risk consumers. However, we are also seeing that arrears and default rates, while still low, are on the rise, particularly for higher credit risk consumers. This is despite favourable credit and economic conditions, which begs the question: if we’re seeing this pattern now, what would happen if there was an economic downturn?
We are also seeing younger people borrowing a lot more relative to their incomes than my, baby boomer, generation. Why is this? It’s because of:
More student borrowing. Our financial lives survey showed that 30% of 25-34 year olds have a Student Loan Company loan. The higher cost of getting onto the housing ladder.
Shifting patterns of savings, borrowing and consumption. You don’t need to wait, you can have it now.
Among 25-34 year olds, 19% have no savings whatsoever, and a further 30% have less than a £1000 saved to use on a rainy day. Indeed, 36% had been overdrawn in the last 12 months.
At the same time, the number of self-employed people in the UK has risen by more than 1.5m since the turn of the century (a 45% increase), and more than 900 thousand people currently are on zero-hours contracts. The gig economy is growing strongly.
So the financial situation for some is precarious.
And we are seeing the potential for further rises in interest rates which could have a significant impact on the cost of debt. There has been a fair amount of attention given to this – particularly in the mortgage world. Our financial lives survey showed that among those who pay mortgage or rent, one in six state that they would struggle if monthly payments increased by less than £50. This equates to 10% of all UK adults. Of these, over a third state they would struggle with even the smallest increase of a pound or two. An unaffordable increase in mortgage payments or rent will of course also have an immediate impact on a consumer’s ability to pay their consumer credit debt.
Finally, and not talked about enough is that we have been seeing, and could see more, spikes in the cost of living. This has been driven in part by a falling pound, driving up the cost of imports such as food and energy. The Office of National Statistics’ figures show that prices including those of staples such as food and transport have grown faster than wages over the past year, putting pressure on households.
You might say that managing the impact of changes in the economic environment on the public is a societal issue and a matter for the government. It is a matter for the government, but it is also a matter for us as a regulator, and as you can see from these examples, a strategic issue for you as the industry.
Getting affordability right
Just because the credit performance is good on certain kinds of debts, doesn’t mean there aren’t problems elsewhere in the customer’s cocktail of debts.
I have talked a lot over the last few years about the importance of getting affordability checks right to prevent harm coming to your customers. The key point for today is that a credit check is not the same as an affordability check.
A few months ago, I was in Liverpool and visited a community centre where they were using a former youth club as a drop in centre for people in financial difficulties. One of the key things I learned was that a lot of the conversations were about how to prioritise payments to creditors. What would be the consequences of prioritising one debt versus another? How could they keep the computer for the kids to do their homework? How could they avoid destroying their credit rating? And I realised that just because the credit performance is good on certain kinds of debts, doesn’t mean there aren’t problems elsewhere in the customer’s cocktail of debts.
And there is more to think about yet. A typical credit check is backward looking. It relies on the future looking much like the past. So, if your customer has not had much debt and a history of meeting their obligations in the past then the assumption is that they will continue to do so in the future.
Given what I have just said about the potential rough weather that some of your customers may face in the future, I hope you can see why a backward-looking credit check isn’t enough. Will the customer be able to repay without causing them wider financial difficulties?
Our rules set this out; that you need to consider the potential for credit to adversely impact the customer’s financial situation – in other words, that the debt will be affordable. We are not overly prescriptive on how you do this. Our CONC handbook requires you to consider likely changes to customer’s situation during the duration of their credit. Our guidance to firms highlights areas for you to consider – including the future financial commitments of the customers, and the future changes in their circumstances.
By comparison, in the mortgage world, we are more prescriptive, and require that firms do an income and expenditure assessment, and test affordability of loans against future interest rate rises. This makes sense, given the length of time that you have to pay off a mortgage and the potential for rates to change over time.
So, what is the relative impact of affordability checks in the mortgage world compared to the consumer credit world?
We see that see that in the months after taking out a mortgage a typical customer significantly increases their consumer credit debt. We’ve seen a trend that households, on average, are £1100 further in debt a year after they’ve taken out a mortgage. I wonder why this is. Are consumers getting smaller mortgages than previously, while borrowing more from other credit providers, because of lower affordability checks in consumer credit? And, if so, is this right?
It seems like common sense to ask and answer questions like:
What might happen if rates rise?
What might happen if the cost of living rises?
Are there indicators that a customers’ circumstances – for example their job situation – could change?
However, I fear that common sense might not be that common. We have seen a lot of firms not doing affordability checks or just doing credit checks.
Although I have mentioned the rules, I hope that you also apply common sense and a forward-looking mindset. Which brings me to my final set of thoughts – about having a healthy forward-looking and customer-focused culture and approach to strategy and business model.
Healthy business models, strategy and culture
I know there are thoughtful leaders in the consumer credit industry, and we have seen this in some of the innovative products you’ve delivered to your customers. The growth of PCP contracts in the motor finance market is a good example of an innovation that has had a significant impact. These contracts don’t require the customer to repay the whole cost of the car over the life of the loan. They also provide flexibility at the end of the agreement by offering the option to return the car, buy it or use any equity built up in the purchase of a new one.
So financing of car ownership has become more affordable, allowing more consumers to have more expensive cars. Indeed, the number of point-of-sale consumer motor finance agreements for new and used cars has nearly doubled from around 1.2m in 2008 to around 2.3m in 2017.
This type of innovation, and business model diversity, paints a really attractive picture of your industry.
It is important to me that we continue this innovation in the sector, and this is why we are not in the business of specifying your business models or strategies. But they do affect the outcomes for consumers and markets so we do care deeply about them; we want to understand them and we want to make sure that they don’t cause harm.
A successful business model also relies on having a healthy firm culture. You need staff that are encouraged to be curious and questioning. Without this, firms might not realise that their business models are unsustainable and can lead not only to reputational damage, but also to the kinds of costly interventions we have been making.
What do I mean by unsustainable business models? A key observation and concern for us is that there are some business models for which customers who can’t afford to repay the principal are profitable, sometimes very profitable. This can lead to outcomes which are unhealthy for the customers. A few examples:
In the realm of high cost short term credit it turned out that you could charge an interest rate so high that customers struggled to ever escape the burden of debt. So we imposed a cap on interest rates and default charges. The high cost short term credit sector is now a lot smaller.
In the credit card market, we have found that some customers were well-nigh perpetually in debt. We found more than 3 million credit cardholders with a total of 4 million accounts in ‘persistent debt’ – paying more in interest and charges than they have repaid of their borrowing over an 18 month period. This is an expensive way to carry longer-term borrowing and can hide underlying financial difficulty. However, firms currently have few incentives to help these customers because they are profitable.
So, we have introduced significant new rules that will mean that both firms and customers are encouraged to avoid credit card debt becoming persistent in the first place, and customers who cannot afford to repay more quickly are given help. We expect customer savings as a result of our new rules to peak at between £310m and £1.3bn a year in lower interest charges.
So I have spoken about the importance of being smart about your business model and culture. What I haven’t spoken about is our proposed rules in relation to culture.
The proposed Senior Managers and Certification Regime introduces five conduct rules. Like our rules on affordability, I don’t think they are overly prescriptive; they represent the minimum standard for the behaviour of individuals.
The five conduct rules are that all financial services employees:
Act with integrity
Act with due care, skill and diligence
Be open and cooperative with the FCA, the PRA and other regulators
Pay due regard to the interests of customers and treat them fairly
Observe proper standards of market conduct
So you can see these are not detailed prescriptions of what to do. In fact, I like to call the SMCR the Accountability regime because it is designed to promote a culture of accountability. I hope that everyone will pause and think about whether what they are doing is right, not just tick the compliance boxes.
A healthy culture can lead to a healthy business.
The accountability regime also, in effect, says that leaders have to be clear on what they are accountable for. More importantly, they should take reasonable steps to make sure that they and those they lead do the right thing. I think a firm which has this kind of culture would see considering what harm might come from a business model to be common sense.
Feedback from many banks that have already implemented the Accountability Regime is that it has created a lot of helpful clarity on who is responsible for what and some robust and healthy conversations about real business issues. So a healthy culture can lead to a healthy business.
Conclusion
Which brings me back to the key point of my remarks today.
We at the FCA often talk about firms putting customers front and centre of what they do.
What does this mean in practice?
It isn’t about another compliance box to tick – a checkbox that says ‘customer wellbeing’. What it means is using common sense and judgement. It means having due regard for the circumstances of the consumers you serve. And it means thinking not only about whether a customer has a history of meeting their obligations, but also whether they are likely to be able to do so in the future.
Because, ultimately, harm coming to consumers means harm coming your way as well – be it through action on our part, or action taken by consumers themselves who vote with their feet. And a business model based on customers who can’t afford to pay you back is hardly a long-term strategy for success.
We all want the same thing – a healthy, sustainable market that serves the consumers who buy from it.
Consumer credit today is a strong performing, growing and innovative sector. I very much hope that as a sector, you will do the work now, to ensure that it also has a healthy future.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

Highlights
The FCA has established itself as a world leading regulator over the last 5 years
There are ways of ensuring that the UK can remain a wholesale banking, asset management and insurance market place for all nationalities
The FCA’s best defense against demands for future regulatory changes will be its own quality
At TheCityUK conference in June 2013, I was not quite 100 days into the formal job. But I made the point that I had gained ‘a healthy respect for how difficult a job it is to be a good regulator’.
In retrospect, perhaps I hadn’t realised quite how difficult a job it was going to be.
I must say that my 5 years have certainly had their ups and downs. Certainly like any new organisation we had our teething problems. Indeed I grew familiar with the former Chair of the Treasury Select Committee describing the organisation as being ‘in special measures’. Absent the benefits of papal infallibility, I learned that regulators frequently find themselves in the role of arbiters of issues without easy answers.
Periodically, and often with little notice, our decisions put us in the firing line of public opinion. Take the most recent topical issue of the publication of the section 166 report into the Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group. Before that the payment protection insurance (PPI) time limit decision. And before that the interest rate hedging products redress process. All 3 difficult decisions taken in good faith, all 3 subject to noisy disagreement to a greater or lesser extent.
Despite these challenges though I do think that the FCA, as The CityUK’s Chief Executive, Miles Celic suggested earlier this month, has established itself as a world-leading regulator. It is also an organisation with a very strong public ethos. A point emphatically demonstrated by the volume and importance of work it has pursued over the last 5 years.
Highlights from the past 5 years
To remind you with a very quick highlights reel. Since 2013, the FCA has engaged on: pension exit charges; general insurance renewals; interest-only mortgage work; foreign exchange and London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) issues and subsequent reform; Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II implementation; the Innovation Hub; our market abuse enforcement work; fixing PPI once and for all; the asset management market study; and of course the Senior Managers Regime.
We have been given new things to regulate, the liability side of the customers’ balance sheet, consumer credit; a new competition objective. We have created the Payments Systems Regulator as a separate subsidiary; and prospectively will pick up credit rating agencies, claims management companies and the work of the Office for Professional Body Anti-Money Laundering Supervision (OPBAS).
Looking back on this work today, I remain struck by its ambition and scale.
However, I also appreciate that activity is not a measure of success; we are no more immune from Parkinson’s Law than anyone else. The value of our work – ultimately – is in outcomes, the difference it makes to society.
How the FCA is succeeding
Frustratingly, 5 years is too short a period to make a bullet proof evaluation, but in my estimation the FCA is succeeding in 2 ways.
First, it is having a direct and positive impact in protecting the many millions of UK households. We have worked on the basis that prevention is far better than cure. This translates into rule making or competition remedies to prevent systemic harm where foreseeable, redress and enforcement in individual firm cases or where damage has already been done.
Second – and this is as important a point – the FCA has been highly influential in transforming attitudes in financial services firms.
I am not naïve enough to imagine that misconduct has disappeared. Nor that Western European capitalism has undergone a spiritual epiphany. But I have witnessed financial services firms promote, and in some cases transform, their attention to customer outcomes from where it was in 2013.
I like to think that, with a few experiments along the way, we have used constructive deterrence to prevent bad things from happening in the first place. Frustratingly, this is the great unmeasurable in drawing up our report card. But in summary, and without unduly tempting fate as to what we don’t yet know, the FCA has put conduct firmly on the map.
As you might imagine, I think it is essential for our vigilance to continue. But I am also conscious that the changes are not without their price.
The FCA itself has grown as it has taken on responsibility for more firms. In 2013/14, we employed around 2,600 staff and regulated some 25,000 firms. Now, the numbers are around 3,400 and 56,000 respectively. Our cost is only one part of the equation.
Add in the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), the fines, the redress, the costs of the internal compliance departments and the processes needed to comply with our rules, and you have an impressive total. A total that is borne ultimately by the customers.
So how we demonstrate public value in this context is very important. Where it is possible to measure value for money quantitatively, we can and we should. Where not, we must advance the qualitative case. We have recently enshrined achieving public value as a core tenet of the FCA, and should be held to account for our performance.
The FCA today
So where does all this leave us today?
To the outside world, I think we are a more trusted and respected organisation than we were at birth. A point underpinned by the latest FCA, Britain Thinks survey, which has shown a steady upward trajectory in public confidence in the organisation. Rising from 6.4 in 2013 to 7.1 this year. The Practitioners Panel annual survey of firms has followed a similar pattern, with satisfaction with the regulator increasing from 5.9 in 2013 to 7.5 in 2017. Without doubt, the FCA is more sure of its direction.
To the outside world, I think we are a more trusted and respected organisation. A point underpinned by the latest FCA, Britain Thinks survey, that has shown a steady upward trajectory in public confidence
The Mission essentially provides a framework to underpin our decision-making, including decisions on prioritisation. An organising philosophy, if you like. I see this as an extremely important step. Traditionally, regulators have tended to concentrate on ‘risks’ to their objectives. An inward focus. The Mission sets out a fundamental switch by concentrating on ‘harm’ to customers and markets. An external focus.
It also establishes how we prioritise and respond to specific issues within markets or firms, as well as decisions on how we operate our individual business units, be that policy, competition, authorisation, supervision or enforcement.
The Mission greatly helps – but it is no cure all.
As I alluded to earlier, arbitrating on difficult decisions requires courage, independence, fairness and wisdom. So even if you disagree with a decision it takes – and sooner or later you will – I trust that you will continue to respect it for the way it goes about its business.
The next 5 years
And so to the future. To me, this is all about the FCA maintaining a stable and respected position as a tectonic plate amongst many others. In no particular order of precedence these include the consuming public, government, parliament, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Bank of England, the law courts, international regulators, the investigative media and of course the firms themselves.
With my crystal ball in hand, I see 4 major challenges ahead in this space that will need to be navigated by the steady helmsmanship of my successor, Charles Randell.
The first is of course Brexit.
In 2013, I believed, along with many others, that London had, since the end of the Second World War, successfully made the transition from a financial centre of necessity to a financial centre of choice.
This has been no mean feat, and as only the British can, over the years we have given ourselves scant credit for a remarkable achievement. Little did we know then how this was about to be tested again by Brexit.
As a technocrat in the conduct space I know that there are ways of ensuring that London can remain a wholesale banking, asset management and insurance market place for all nationalities, safeguarded by a system of sound regulation and established law at least equivalent to the best of the rest.
I know that there are ways of ensuring that London can remain a wholesale banking, asset management and insurance market place for all nationalities, safeguarded by a system of sound regulation and established law at least equivalent to the best of the rest
Furthermore, I know that the FCA will play its full part in making the very best of the hand that gets dealt.
But, as we all know, we are not the only tectonic plate in town, and the all too adjacent grinding noise of politics bumping up against economics makes the long term outcome uncertain. Very recently both the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have set out their views of what the country wants from the negotiations for the financial sector, I am sure we all wish them well in what will be a tough few months.
Prior to these speeches, many people had been urging the FCA to take a more public opinionated stance on Brexit. I wholly endorse Andrew Bailey’s measured comments in public coupled with his intense and influential activity in private. The FCA will, after all, need to be there regulating, whatever the outcome. One thing is clear in my mind, I have no time for any sort of regulatory race to lower standards. On the contrary, I believe that the FCA’s excellence as a regulator is crucial in facilitating The City’s successful future in a Brexit world.
Another perpetual fault line will remain the perimeter between policy, regulation and unregulated activity. Based on my personal interaction with many consumer and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) campaigners for change over the past 5 years, I have developed the greatest respect for their energy, drive and commitment – without them the world would be a poorer place.
But respect is not the same thing as agreement, and some of the issues on which campaigns run most strongly require a change in the social contract, and therefore logically the law, rather than in the FCA’s rule book or the opinion of its leadership.
I believe that these should be for an elected government to direct and/or for Parliament to enact, in order to ensure the long-term independence of the regulator. High profile examples from my tenure have included enhanced regulatory protection for SMEs, the treatment of high-cost credit, the need, or otherwise, for a duty of care, the emerging consequences of pensions freedom.
Technological advances provide an additional rich source of new issues, use and abuse of data, personalised differential pricing, and the power of network effects in promoting dominant players. The hot topic of the day is what to do about cryptocurrencies, to which on the one hand the official sector does not wish to afford the status of a currency, but which are being advertised to the consumer as alluring investments on billboards in Canary Wharf. Therefore have all the potential of causing consumer harm unless brought within the regulatory perimeter.
Less high profile, but arguably as important is the relationship between the legal and regulatory process. There is a significant mismatch between the external view of the powers that we have and should therefore use, and the legal constraints that we, internally, feel we constantly need to have regard to. These include European law, exposure to judicial review, appeal to the Upper Tribunal and beyond, the infamous but wholly necessary privacy requirements of section 348, and more basic concepts of natural justice such as innocent until proven guilty.
In the grand scheme of things the checks and balances have worked reasonably well in my tenure but I am struck by the inaccessibility to the law by the consumer, on the triple grounds of speed, complexity and cost. ‘Justice delayed is justice denied' has more than an element of truth to it in money matters. A 4-year legal process and a dense thicket of jurisprudential argument provide a far less attractive route to redress than the use of 24/7 media and the associated parliamentary support to pressurise the regulator to short circuit due process in contentious cases. I am further struck by the ready availability of civil justice in the UK to the globally wealthy, whilst out of financial reach to most British citizens.
Last but not least on my to-do list is the relationship between the regulator and the regulated. Tracey McDermott used to speak about pendulum regulation, and the desirability of avoiding it whatever the short-term expedient. I could not agree more. It is not possible in as short a period as 5 years to be sure that the FCA has established itself sufficiently robustly to resist pressure to move position should it arise, as it certainly will one day.
Our best defensive bulwark is of course our own excellence, but it will be greatly helped by a financial services sector that has regained the trust and support of the country at large.
Whilst considerable progress has been made since the dark days of 2008, there is, by general consensus, still a long way to go. We, the FCA, will continue to put the conduct agenda high on your list of priorities, but the real agent of change, culture, remains largely under the control of the firms themselves. Or put more succinctly, in the short-term you get the regulator you have, in the long-term you will get the regulator you deserve.
Working at the FCA
I cannot end without paying a tribute to the people who work at the FCA. As I rapidly discovered, being a regulator is not an easy job. At one level it is a three and a half thousand people business, like many others in the sector, at another it has a very special ethos, seeking to do the right things to meet the incredibly important objectives it has been set and doing so often under the glare of intense public scrutiny.
It has been both a great privilege and an unmissable experience to have played a modest part in moulding the FCA into a fundamental building block of the country’s single most important industry
I greatly admire all of the people who pass through the FCA, from the 3 Chief Executives I have worked with: Martin, Tracey and Andrew, through fellow Board members to the most junior new joiners. I cannot speak for any of them but I remember how, when the announcement of my appointment was made, my friends fell into 2 broad categories, those who wondered whether I knew what I was letting myself in for and those who knew I clearly didn’t.
I leave that judgement to you. From my perspective it has been both a great privilege and an unmissable experience to have played a modest part in moulding the FCA into a fundamental building block of the country’s single most important industry. I wish everyone involved all the very best, especially Charles as my successor.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority

FCA publishes discussion paper on transforming culture in financial services,Press Releases,12/03/2018,12/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-publishes-discussion-paper-transforming-culture-financial-services,"The paper is a set of essays that discuss what a good culture might look like, the role of regulation and regulators, how firms might go beyond incentives, and how to change behaviour for the better.
Culture and governance is a priority for the FCA and we have a strong focus on the role of the individual as well as the firm. The FCA has considered the role of leaders, incentives and capabilities, and governance of decision making. The introduction of the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR) is an example of this; it sets minimum standards for the behaviour of financial services staff and aims to promote a culture where Senior Managers take responsibility for identifying where harm might occur, and take action to prevent it. The SM&CR creates a formal link between the behaviour of individuals and the conduct of the firm.
Jonathan Davidson, FCA Executive Director of Supervision - Retail and Authorisations, said:
“Culture may not be easily measurable but it is manageable. So firms can and should take responsibility for ensuring their culture is healthy for both their employees and customers, which can complement and support their business strategy.
“We as a regulator have long gone beyond having the mindset that simply complying with rules is enough. However we don’t believe a one size fits all culture is the right way to go. So we want to promote a discussion and consensus on the essential features of a healthy culture and how firms, regulators, employees and customers can help deliver that culture.'
The FCA would like all those with an interest in financial services to consider the issues in the paper and to engage in the debate about what constitutes a healthy culture, and how to promote it.
Notes to editors
DP18/2: Transforming culture in financial services
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

Mr Hope has been remanded in custody until Thursday 15 March 2018, when it is anticipated that a date for sentencing will be set.
Notes to editors
A current indictment is available from the FCA press office.
On 30 January 2015 Mr Hope was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment for fraud and operating a collective investment scheme without authorisation.
Press release related to Mr Hope’s confiscation order.
On 27 September 2016 Mr Hope was committed to prison for a further 603 days by the City of Westminster Magistrates’ Court as a result of him having only paid £1,000 towards his confiscation order
On 30 November 2017, Mr Hope was charged with perverting the course of justice.

The FCA found that Mr Flowers’ conduct demonstrated a lack of fitness and propriety required to work in financial services.
Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight said:
“The role of Chair occupies a unique place of trust and influence. The Chair is pivotal in setting expectations of a company’s culture, values and behaviours.
“Mr Flowers failed in his duty to lead by example and to meet the high standards of integrity and probity demanded by the role. These high standards are what the financial services industry and the wider community rightly expect of its senior individuals. Where a Chair, or other senior individual, fails to discharge these standards the FCA will hold them to account.'
The FCA found that Mr Flowers has demonstrated an unwillingness to comply not only with the FCA’s requirements and standards but also with other legal, regulatory and professional requirements. The FCA believes Mr Flowers’ disregard for the standards he is expected to meet demonstrates a lack of integrity and that any future involvement by Mr Flowers in the financial services industry risks undermining consumer and market confidence.
The FCA found that while Chair Mr Flowers:
used his work mobile telephone to make a number of inappropriate telephone calls to a premium rate chat line in breach of Co-op Group and Co-op Bank policies; and
used his work email account to send and receive sexually explicit and otherwise inappropriate messages, and to discuss illegal drugs, in breach of Co-op Group and Co-op Bank policies despite having been previously warned about his earlier misconduct.
In addition, after stepping down as Chair, Mr Flowers was convicted for possession of illegal drugs.
Throughout its investigation into Mr Flowers, the FCA has liaised with and received the support of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). The FCA thanks the PRA for its support.

"FCA fines and bans former Deutsche Bank trader, Guillaume Adolph",Press Releases,05/03/2018,05/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-and-bans-former-deutsche-bank-trader-guillaume-adolph,"Mr Adolph formerly worked at Deutsche Bank as a short-term interest rate derivatives trader, trading products referenced to CHF (Swiss Franc) and JPY (Japanese Yen) LIBOR. For a period of time, Mr Adolph acted as the primary JPY LIBOR submitter for Deutsche.
Mark Steward, Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA said:
“Mr Adolph improperly influenced several of Deutsche’s LIBOR submissions in disregard of standards governing LIBOR submissions.  Mr Adolph’s misconduct threatened the integrity of important benchmarks.  He should have no further role in the financial services industry.'
The FCA found that between 25 July 2008 and 11 March 2010, Mr Adolph:
made requests to Deutsche’s CHF LIBOR Submitters to adjust their submissions to benefit Mr Adolph’s Trading Positions;
took his own trading positions into account when acting as Deutsche’s primary JPY LIBOR submitter; and
improperly agreed with a trader at another LIBOR panel bank to make JPY LIBOR submissions which took into account that trader’s requests.
The FCA has found that Mr Adolph closed his mind to the risk that these actions were improper.  He was also knowingly concerned in Deutsche’s failure to observe proper standards of market conduct.   Accordingly, the FCA has determined that he is not a fit and proper person to perform any regulated financial activity. On 21 January 2014, the FCA issued Mr Adolph with a Warning Notice, but proceedings were stayed due to the ongoing criminal investigation of the Serious Fraud Office into certain individuals who formerly worked at Deutsche Bank.

Restrictions imposed on Beaufort Securities Limited (BSL) and Beaufort Asset Clearing Services Limited (BACSL) and both Firms are placed into insolvency,Press Releases,02/03/2018,02/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/restrictions-imposed-beaufort-securities-limited-bsl-and-beaufort-asset-clearing-services-limited,"The FCA took this action following an assessment of the financial positions of BSL and BACSL (the Firms) which led the FCA to believe that both Firms are insolvent. The FCA also considers it necessary for insolvency practitioners to take over the running of the Firms in order to protect assets from dissipation and protect customers of both Firms. This action is also necessary due to concerns that the Firms may be involved in financial crime.
The FCA is assisting the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) with its separate investigation into BSL’s involvement in securities fraud related to stock of various US publicly-traded companies and international money laundering associated with that conduct. The DOJ unsealed an indictment yesterday in which BSL, in addition to other companies and individuals, has been charged with securities fraud and money laundering violations.
The FCA has also imposed requirements on the Firms, with immediate effect, using its own-initiative powers under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the Act), requiring the Firms to cease all regulatory activity and not to dispose of any firm or client assets without the FCA’s consent. 
The FCA also considers that the Firms are unable to satisfy the FCA’s threshold conditions of Appropriate Resources, Suitability and Effective Supervision. 
The FCA is conducting an investigation into the affairs of both Firms and these actions have been taken to protect UK consumers. 
Under the requirements imposed on the Firms on 1 March 2018:
The Firms must cease to carry on any regulated activity and any business activity that is carried on in connection with a regulated activity, or held out as being for the purposes of a regulated activity (including not initiating any further such business);
The Firms must not dispose of, deal with or diminish the value of any of their assets (whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) without the prior consent of the FCA; and
The Firms are also subject to an assets requirement over all the client money and safe custody assets they hold for clients with no provision for anything other than to settle unclosed trades.
The Firms must also take appropriate steps to inform their clients they will no longer be able to conduct any regulated activities.
The FCA’s investigation is continuing.
The joint administrators / joint special administrators will contact all affected customers of the Firms in due course. If customers of the Firms require more information about how they will be affected, they should visit the PwC website or call the helpline UK: 0800 063 9283 or International: +44 (0)20 7293 0227.

Recent developments in financial markets,Speeches,01/03/2018,09/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/recent-developments-financial-markets,"Speaker: Andrew Bailey, Chief ExecutiveEvent: AFME, ICMA and ISDA breakfast briefingDelivered: 1 March 2018Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version
Highlights
This speech gives an overview of the state of financial markets in the UK
We provide an update on implementation of MiFID II, which is working well for market participants
Work on the replacements for LIBOR and the transition to alternate reference rates is underway but there are still issues with legacy contracts
It is a great pleasure to be at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), International Capital Market Association (ICMA) and International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) briefing this morning and can I thank all of you for having the appetite for a speech on wholesale financial markets at breakfast-time. Of course, for the true devotees, I am sure there is nothing at all unusual about this.
And, that's a convenient introduction to my first point, which is a very long overdue thanks to a former colleague at the Bank of England and I know a mainstay of ICMA, Paul Richards. It is fashionable these days, for obvious reasons, to look for the magic ingredients that make London such a successful wholesale financial centre. What is it that marks London out? There is no single answer, of course, but one thing London does have is a tradition of people who can bridge the worlds of policy and practice and help us to knit the two together. And, I can tell you from more than twenty years of knowing Paul, that he is one of the finest exponents of that art. We first worked together at the Bank when Paul was leading something called Practical Preparations for the Introduction of the Euro. The UK wasn’t going to join the euro area, but the Bank was determined that London would be ready to trade and clear the euro as well as provide the full range of capital market services. And London was ready, thanks in good part to Paul’s work. It was prescient as we now know. Wind the clock forward, and you can probably work out how pleased I was that Paul and ICMA – along with AFME and ISDA – are deeply engaged in work on Brexit and that Paul is chairing a key group on practical plans for reforming London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
While I am on the subject of thank yous, can I also extend it to AFME, ICMA, ISDA, Martin Scheck and all the many people involved in your work. I have to say that for me AFME, ICMA and ISDA are role models for how we as an authority work with markets and trade bodies. We benefit greatly from your deep knowledge and unfailing willingness to help us and help market participants.
For the rest of the time, I am going to talk about developments in markets, the introduction of MiFID II and say something about our work on LIBOR.
Recent market developments
Throughout last year, one of the themes of discussion on financial markets was just how insulated they were to news, and particularly news which appeared to increase risks to asset values or increase the general level of uncertainty. And, there was no shortage of such news last year. I have seen this before, and as a policymaker who is required to assess risks, it never feels comfortable when markets are so resolute in their ‘treatment’ of risks.
It never feels comfortable when markets are so resolute in their ‘treatment’ of risks.
I should say that in overall financial stability terms, this is only one part of a bigger picture, and there are important countervailing developments, not least the progressive and increasing resilience of the core banking system which is the product of a decade of heavy lifting in terms of policy reforms.
We had to wait until a month or so ago to see sharp falls in the price of risky assets and a corresponding rise in volatility. Realised and implied market volatility spiked and the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Volatility Index (VIX) experienced its largest ever one day move reaching its highest level since 2015. But falling equity prices were not accompanied by a commensurate increase in spreads of high-yield corporate bonds, and there was little movement in investment-grade spreads.
Volatility may have been amplified by some investors needing to close out leveraged volatility based strategies. The net effect of several large market-based players trading in the same direction created a ‘herding effect’ which may have exacerbated the market moves. We also know that in conditions when market moves become larger, liquidity, which will dampen the effect of smaller moves, will decrease. What we do know is that the experience of the spike in volatility has led to a significant fall in outstanding exposure to inverse VIX products which can be used to sell volatility. Market information also suggests that some large investors reduced their short volatility positions ahead of the spike up in volatility. There are, however, already some indications that short volatility positions are beginning to be re-established.
Stepping back from these events a little, what we have seen in recent times is the lack of inherent market volatility has led to the growth of strategies targeting volatility by investors, thus increasing risk-taking when volatility falls and cutting exposure when it rises. It is not clear yet to what extent such strategies may have contributed to amplifying recent market moves. But there is clearly scope here for pro-cyclical behaviour, and that brings its own risks. It would, of course, be easy to say that such strategies are an inevitable feature of a search for returns in a world of very low, real interest rates though this should not be overdone as an argument since volatility will be traded irrespective of the level of rates. But should we ignore the risks to the financial system that can accompany these strategies? Far from it, we should be vigilant and inquisitive.
If I step back further, it is of course possible to tell stories to explain last year’s dismissal of adverse news as a response to revisions to both the prospects for, and evidence of, growth in the world economy, and a continuation of subdued inflation expectations. These have been key features of the supportive environment for asset prices. With that has come a compression of estimated term premia relative to historical levels, and broader evidence that investors are accepting lower compensation for risk. These are all signals that we need to be on high alert, but in doing so recognise the resilience that has been built into the system post-crisis.
Now, there is a respectable argument that this resilience is concentrated in the banking system and not in the world of market-based finance. Moreover, meanwhile, the reaction to the financial crisis has been to see a shift in the form of financial intermediation from bank balance sheets to market-based activity by investors typically through investment management vehicles. There is a logic to this shift evidence for which can be seen in the rapid, too rapid, growth of bank balance sheets before the onset of the crisis a decade ago. This was particularly pronounced in the trading books of banks. Today, the picture is very different.
But this change in financial intermediation does beg some important questions. Three stand out. First, does the decline in bank intermediation mean that their role as shock absorbers by expanding dealer inventories in times of market correction mean that the system is now at risk in a way that threatens stability? And, second, is the system exposed to pro-cyclical behaviour by investors as they seek to exit en masse? Third, are there features of the structure of the system today, such as the larger number of open-ended investment funds, which mean that there are risks to stability which need to be tackled?
I have argued in the past that I think we should be cautious about assuming that in the good old days dealer inventory stood in the face of the storm and absorbed and checked falling markets. Moreover, the era of larger trading books was short-lived before the crisis, and it didn’t end well. Still, we have to take these risks seriously because it would be tragic if all the progress on bank resilience was undone by a flaw somewhere else in the system. So, what have we learned from recent events? We should be circumspect here. We had a fairly short-lived spike in volatility, and some major price moves. So far, the system has stabilised and the episode was fairly short-lived. And, to be clear, that is not a prediction of what will or will not happen next. So far, the system has dealt with this spike in volatility and fall in asset prices. But, if this is it – and again no prediction intended – it hasn’t been a major system-level event. So, let’s not get carried away.
It won't deflect us from a number of important pieces of work that we have underway in this field. I would point out two areas here. First, we have been looking hard at the risks from open-ended fund structures following the experience with property funds after the European Union (EU) referendum. Again, that was a major event at the time, which can look a bit less major with the benefit of time and perspective. But, we didn’t know this at the time. What I think is important here is that investor expectations and understanding matches well the form and structure of the investment vehicles they use.
What I think is important here is that investor expectations and understanding matches well the form and structure of the investment vehicles they use.
The second important piece of work, and something on which the FCA and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) recently put out papers, concerns algorithmic trading. We have some quite notorious examples of cases where algos are used poorly, and there can be wider fall-out.
To be clear, our intent is not to stand in the way of the use of algos, but rather to ensure that firms have robust governance, risk management and compliance standards. Used well, they are an obvious innovation in trading, but used badly they can cause wider risks to the system.
MiFID II
The last two months have seen another important event, the introduction of Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) in early January. AFME, ICMA and ISDA played an important role here too, bridging the world of policy and practice, for which many thanks.
For our part, we were very clear that the highest priority was that the introduction of MiFID II, which was a massive undertaking, did not lead to market disruption. Sometimes I get challenged on this, on the ‘rules are rules’ basis – it doesn’t matter what happens to markets as long as the rules are obeyed. No. We have had a lot of experience in London of balancing our objectives whilst ensuring the continuity of markets.
We were very clear that the highest priority was that the introduction of MiFID II, which was a massive undertaking, did not lead to market disruption.
A few days after MiFID II came in, a senior market practitioner said to me, I think as a compliment, that it had gone much more smoothly then they expected. It was too good an opportunity to miss to point out that this probably said more about their expectation than the actuality. But, still, in the world of implementing complex EU legislation, don’t turn down a compliment.
Whatever you think of MiFID II, you can't deny its ambition. It seeks to boost investor protection and enhance market transparency, efficiency and oversight. An important part of this objective is to migrate significant volumes of trading from over-the-counter (OTC) markets towards more transparent trading venues. If you want to engage in debate on the EU as a rule-making body, then MiFID II is for you – over 30,000 pages of rules.
It is, of course, very early days. But we can now say that the new systems have accommodated heavy trading as market volatility spiked in February, and stood up to the test. We have seen a pronounced downturn in OTC equity trading, as expected. There have been delays in introducing some of the planned measures, notably the double volume cap which limits dark trading. I have no doubt that across the EU, the data systems will get up to speed and enable this to happen and I am relaxed that it will happen robustly without disrupting markets. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has said it will happen in March.
Likewise, we have not seen disruption to bond markets. It is hard to pick out any particular MiFID II effects on bond spreads given all the other developments in markets over the last two months.
Capital markets that support the real economy need to be accessible, efficient, clean, resilient and sufficiently liquid. MiFID II tackles these objectives by taking into account the particular role played by venues providing access to capital for smaller firms; extending transparency from equity to bond and derivatives markets, with the aim of promoting efficiency in those markets too, while maintaining access to liquidity; enhancing the scope of instruments within the market abuse regime and the quality of the data provided to us to police it with; and reinforcing the controls in place to support resilience in times of extreme market conditions.
It is too soon to say whether these aims have been realised. But we can reflect on our experience of the initial implementation. Wholesale firms made a very significant effort to prepare for the implementation of MiFID II, for which many thanks. I know that this comes with a cost. Despite some inevitable roughness around the edges, the preparations paid off with no major operational disruptions to trading – and evidence that the changes have not adversely affected liquidity across equities, bonds and derivatives.
Obviously, we are continuing to monitor the effects of MiFID II, which we recognise will only play out in full over a period of time. Also there is inevitably more to do on implementation for both firms and regulators, particularly on reporting. We expect firms to be working to tackle issues and we also recognise that there remain some important interpretative issues to address.
Prior to implementation we said that our approach to enforcement of MiFID II would be consistent with our general effective and proportionate approach to the use of our enforcement powers. To be clear, it was not our intention to offer forbearance; we expect firms to comply with their obligations. But we thought it important to confirm that we would not use our enforcement powers in a disproportionate manner.
We discussed implementation extensively with firms last year. We are continuing our supervisory engagement with firms and our 2018/2019 Business Plan will set out the thematic work we will conduct over the next year on issues relating to MiFID II.
A key challenge for firms in implementation was the expanded transaction reporting requirements. These involved a step change in both the volume and quality of data we receive regarding transactions taking place in the market.
The FCA, alongside ESMA, undertook extensive technological work to be ready to receive, interrogate and ultimately learn from this dataset. We estimate that under MiFID, we will capture some 30-35 million transaction reports a day, up from 20 million before its introduction. The volume of reports reflects the role of London as a global financial centre. There is a determination on our part to exploit the full possibilities of these data to support our efforts to deter, detect and punish market abuse. 
LIBOR
That’s enough MiFID II for one breakfast. Just when you thought it was safe to go out as I have finished on that one, let me end with a few words on LIBOR.
As I have said before, LIBOR reference rates are no longer supported by significant volumes on transactions. This puts panel or submitting banks in a difficult position. Work on the transition to alternate reference rates is underway around the world. In the UK this is being driven by the cross-market group (as referenced earlier) which is focused on sterling bond markets, under Paul’s able leadership. It brings together sell side, buy side and non-financial firms. Its work spans derivative and cash markets, with sub-groups already meeting on bond markets, loan markets, and pensions, amongst other issues.
Work on the transition to alternate reference rates is underway around the world.
In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) has also been reconstituted to facilitate a broader transition. In Switzerland there is focus now on specific retail and derivatives transition issues. In Japan the Risk Free Rates Working Group is encouraging financial institutions to use the Overnight Indexed Swap (OIS), which is critical to transition. The market led work is now starting in the euro area, and the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided it will publish an overnight rate, starting in 2019.
There seems to be a consensus that interest rate markets will, in future, be centred on the Risk Free Rates chosen by various industry groups – like (Sterling Over Night Index Average) SONIA in the UK and Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the US. The expectation is that this will lead to a stronger financial system. For the many LIBOR users for whom it was never an ideal reference rate, a shift of liquidity into the chosen risk free rates offers an opportunity for better hedges and lower risk exposures.
Those who want to hedge interest rate risks will be able to choose a reference rate that does not include an unwanted, but economically significant, credit risk component. Borrowers should have better access to variable rates that do not make them carry the risk that their interest payments will go up because confidence in their banks has fallen.
This leaves a very big question unanswered. It is all very well to talk about a future with new benchmarks, and one that importantly matches closely to interest rate risk, but what about the very large legacy of contracts? There will be cases where it is not practical or economic to change reference rates. The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Benchmark Administration has opened up the prospect of a voluntary arrangement to sustain LIBOR after the end of 2021. I don’t rule this out, but I would stress that I don’t see a prospect of a reversal in the decline of the market activity that LIBOR seeks to measure, and the FCA has not changed its position that it is not going to use powers of compulsion towards submitters beyond that point. My best guess is that some panel banks would already have departed were it not for the voluntary agreement to stay in until the end of 2021 that we were able to obtain.
Now, I would not rule out that it might be possible to produce a form of LIBOR proxy which could satisfy the legal definition of what LIBOR is taken to be and serve as a legacy benchmark. This is at root a question of legal interpretation. Would it, for instance, be possible to create a synthetic LIBOR which amounts to a risk-free rate plus an add-on? I’m not sure, but we are encouraging this issue to be assessed as soon as possible. I do not, to be clear, see this as an alternative to the risk free rates as the best measure of interest rate risk, but it is worth assessing whether this could be the way to assist with the legacy.
Conclusion
Let me conclude. There is as you can see no shortage of issues on the agenda, and I have managed to get through this morning without mentioning the B-word. We will continue to work very closely with AFME, ICMA, ISDA. We appreciate the support you give to us and we benefit from your insights.

FCA value measures pilot having a positive impact,Press Releases,01/03/2018,01/03/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-value-measures-pilot-having-positive-impact,"The publication of value measures data was one of the remedies from the FCA’s general insurance add-ons market study, which found poor value in both add-on, and some stand-alone, products. The FCA also found that consumers, firms and other organisations found it difficult to assess value due to the lack of a commonly available measure of value.
To help address these issues, the FCA said it would pilot the publication of value measures data. The data published include claims frequencies, claims acceptance rates and average claims pay-outs by insurer, for four general insurance products:
home insurance (combined buildings and contents)
home emergency insurance
personal accident insurance sold as an add-on to motor or home insurance
key cover sold as an add-on to motor insurance
Christopher Woolard, Executive Director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA, said:
“Publishing value measures data increases the range of information available about general insurance products. This will help increase market focus on suitability and value, as well as the headline price.
“We have already seen examples of where publishing the first set of data has incentivised insurers to make product improvements and focus more on overall product value.'
The second set of data relates to 36 insurers and covers the year ended 31 August 2017.
The data collected are part of a pilot designed to allow the FCA to further develop the measures and collect evidence of their impact. This evidence will inform a decision on whether to publish a consultation on new rules for firms to report value measures data. We have previously said the pilot will run for a minimum of two years, with the possibility of a third set of pilot data for the year ending 31 August 2018. We will decide later this year whether to undertake a third pilot.
Notes to editors
The data are available here.
See the general insurance add-ons market study.
On 1 April 2013, the FCA became responsible for the conduct supervision of all regulated financial firms and the prudential supervision of those not supervised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.

The Consumer Credit landscape today,Speeches,27/02/2018,27/02/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/consumer-credit-landscape-today,"Speaker: Andrew Bailey, Chief ExecutiveEvent: Finance & Leasing Association (FLA), LondonDelivered: 27 February 2018Note: this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version
Highlights
The FCA has been regulating consumer credit for almost four years and it continues to be a key sector for the FCA.
We are looking at developments in consumer credit to ensure that lending is affordable and sustainable.
We recognise that consumer credit is not a monolithic market and we are intervening on specific products including credit cards, overdrafts and rent-to-own.
It is a pleasure to be here tonight. You don’t need me to remind you what an important role Finance & Leasing Association (FLA) members play in the economy and society. We certainly see it at the FCA, and I don’t mean that in a way to cause undue alarm.
I am going to focus on consumer credit tonight. I will start with some very broad observations, then tackle what we are doing in the consumer credit area, and finish up with some points on our supervision.
Probably the largest thing that has happened to the FCA in the first 5 years of its life is taking on the regulation of consumer credit, which it did in 2014, around the time of its first birthday. This added around 34,000 firms to the FCA’s total, taking it from around 24,000 to around 57,000. Actually, that is a net figure because during the last nearly 4 years around 36,000 consumer credit firms have come in and nearly 2,000 have gone out. Now, I think I can say safely that not all these firms belong to the FLA, not quite anyway – if they did, you would be looking for a larger venue tonight.
The economic background
We are living through a period of profound changes which affect all of us.
We are living through a period of profound changes which affect all of us as citizens and your businesses. Long-term real interest rates have been on a downward path since the 1980s. More recently, since the global financial crisis, in many industrialised countries they have fallen well below zero. This is unprecedented over such a long period of time in conditions of peacetime and stable inflation.
The fall in the real cost of debt has supported the rise in household borrowing. A good part of this has been a story about rising house prices and the accompanying increase in mortgage debt. But also, and particularly in recent years, we have seen a strong growth in consumer credit, and particularly among younger people.
Evidence for this was also provided by an important piece of work we did last year, called Understanding the Financial Lives of UK Adults, or Financial Lives for short. It is a detailed study of a sample of UK adults, and all the data are available on our website – feel free to use them to support your own work. If there is any such thing as a free gift from the FCA, Financial Lives is as near as it gets.
According to our survey, the age group between 18 and 34 have the highest levels of unsecured debt, averaging just over £8,000 per head including Student Loans Company loans (and student loans are significant here). It is also notable that in the 25-34 age group, 36% have been overdrawn in the last 12 months, 13% were overdrawn at the time of the survey, and 23% were considered to be over-indebted.
Developments in Consumer Credit
It is reassuring that credit growth has not been disproportionately driven by those who are most vulnerable.
But – and this is an important but – we should be careful not to generalise. We published another important piece of work recently, done with staff at the Bank of England, which asked the question ‘Who’s driving consumer credit growth?’. We analysed credit reference agency data for 1 in 10 UK consumers covering most types of borrowing, going back 6 years. We had 3 main conclusions: credit growth has not been driven by those with the lowest credit ratings; it has mainly been driven by people without mortgages; and people remain indebted for longer than product-level data suggest.
To give you an example, borrowing on credit cards with 0% offers and motor finance are concentrated among people with higher credit scores. And, motor finance and 0% credit cards have accounted for a majority of consumer credit growth since 2012. In contrast, people borrowing on interest-bearing credit cards tend to have lower credit scores.
What do we make of all this? As you know, consumer credit is not a monolith. It is a series of markets. It is reassuring that credit growth has not been disproportionately driven by those who are most vulnerable. But, I am not sanguine here. As I will go on to describe, even though the high-cost credit markets are small as a share of total consumer credit, and even though they are not the fastest growing, as a conduct regulator with a consumer responsibility my conclusion from our work is that the main issues and problems are in these markets. And, this is where there is a higher concentration of more vulnerable consumers.
Firms need to ensure that any lending they advance, whether high-cost credit or not, is affordable and sustainable. Of course, borrowing can become unaffordable due to a change in circumstances, whether personal or macro-economic, that could not have been reasonably foreseen. But it is important that firms guard against that risk, by having effective policies and procedures for assessment of creditworthiness, including affordability.
We published a consultation last year, aimed at clarifying our regulatory expectations. In doing so, we are not looking to be prescriptive. We want firms to have reasonable discretion to make decisions according to the individual circumstances, and taking account of the risks to the borrower, but we also want to set clear parameters.
Of course, affordability assessment can never be an exact science, and things will happen that were unforeseen, so we also want firms to monitor customer accounts and act promptly where there are signs of actual or potential financial difficulties, and to treat customers in default or arrears difficulties with forbearance and due consideration.
FCA Priorities
Consumer credit is an important part of our supervisory and policy business plan as we continue to work through issues that we perceive to be present in the industry. I want to review briefly our work across the market in its different sections.
Today, we have announced the rules to implement the changes resulting from our study of the credit card market. In our work, we identified that around 5 million people experience real difficulties in paying off their balance and credit cards have become a source of long-term expensive debt, something for which they were not designed. And, it is not untypical for such consumers to be paying around £2.50 in interest and charges for every pound of balance they repay. Firms can lack incentives to tacking this as these customers are profitable.
We have therefore introduced a set of measures designed to reduce the number of people with persistent credit card debt, provide individuals with greater control over credit limit increases and ensure that firms intervene to help customers with persistent debt, including providing options to switch to cheaper loans and show forbearance.
I would stress that credit has a role to play, for instance in smoothing more erratic incomes or enabling the purchase of essential goods.
There has been debate about whether we should be tougher by requiring action on credit card debt sooner in the cycle of events that can befall customers. We think that the timelines that we will require for intervention are sensible and reflect experience in the market and patterns of use. It is though, a delicate balance between requiring measures to be taken sooner and thus impacting people’s use of cards, and not leaving it too late and seeing debt problems escalate. So, we will keep this under review as the new rules come into effect.
Let me move on to car lending. The majority of new car finance is now in the form of Personal Contract Purchase (PCPs), with which many FLA members are very familiar. Use of PCPs has grown rapidly in recent years. But, as I have said before, the shift to PCP based lending to finance cars recognises the nature of a car as an asset, with consumers more comfortable leasing or renting than owning outright. There is logic to this. That said, we are looking carefully at a number of possible conduct approaches by lenders:
Are firms taking the right steps to ensure that they lend responsibly, in particular by appropriately assessing whether potential customers can afford the product in question?
Are there conflicts of interest arising from commission arrangements between lenders and dealers, and if so are these appropriately managed to avoid harm to consumers?
Is the information provided to potential customers by firms sufficiently clear and transparent, so that they can understand the risks involved and make informed decisions?
Are firms managing the risk that asset valuations could fall and ensuring that they are adequately pricing risk?
We expect to publish an update of this work in March.
Turning to high-cost credit, and the range of lending products for those who are less well-off and with worse credit scores, I would stress that credit has a role to play, for instance in smoothing more erratic incomes or enabling the purchase of essential goods that would otherwise prove too expensive. Nonetheless we are concerned about the cost and terms of such credit and the propensity for over-indebtedness. And these things are linked. Some of the terms encourage over-indebtedness with little or no incentive to pay down debts.
We are prepared to intervene and propose new rules where we have the evidence that markets are not working well for consumers.
There is an emerging picture of a case for possible intervention in a number of markets but also a recognition of the limits of what can be achieved through traditional regulatory interventions alone. Looking at the shape of the overall market and considering how choices for consumers might be widened is therefore important context. In particular, in certain parts of the market we will seek to intervene to encourage alternatives to high-cost credit, particular those from the ‘mid-cost’ market.
The principles of our approach are:
We authorise, supervise and enforce against our existing rules – we have already taken significant action where firms have not met our rulebook including creditworthiness and treating customers fairly.
We are prepared to intervene and propose new rules where we have the evidence that markets are not working well for consumers.
We can promote competition and innovation in the interest of consumers by encouraging new business models that better serve consumers, and addressing rules that might be preventing markets from working as well as they could.
We can work with others to influence the demand in markets thinking about what drives demand for high-cost credit, the alternatives and how consumers can build basic financial resilience.
We are concerned about the high fees and charges for unarranged overdrafts, especially when compared to their relatively small size. In 2016, for the 5 largest providers, annual revenues from unarranged overdrafts were around 200% of the average amount outstanding. The fees are also highly concentrated among users. Over half of total charges on unarranged overdrafts were applied to just 2% of accounts. We are concerned the pattern of repeated use of such overdrafts that lies behind this concentration may be exacerbating financial difficulties and therefore harm for consumers. Based on our work, we are assessing whether we should act to simplify charges to ensure they are clear and better reflect actual use as well as the role of unarranged overdrafts more broadly in today’s market. Arranged overdrafts are also part of this picture, though their costs are lower.
The FCA has a programme of work across all the firms offering other forms of high-cost credit. I will take rent-to-own as an example.
Since 2014, our supervisory work on rent-to-own has achieved better outcomes for consumers. Firms are now more transparent when displaying the cash value of goods, the amount of interest to be paid, and the total cost to customers. Our work has resulted in the unbundling of compulsory warranties and insurance. These are now offered separately and customers are able to obtain their own insurance cover instead. Together these developments help consumers understand what they are paying for and make it easier to compare prices with other retailers. We have also seen the firms change their business models in response to our concerns – including how they assess affordability and the action they take to help those in long term financial difficulties. Our work has so far resulted in nearly £16m of compensation being paid to around 308,000 consumers. This compensation relates to historic poor practices including unaffordable lending and inappropriate charges and fees. If we discover any further instances of consumer harm, we will require the firms to put things right for any affected consumers. We continue to have concerns around the cost of using this type of credit, particularly where add-on products are included. We are gathering further evidence as part of our High-cost Credit Review and we will present our conclusions in May. Looking across the range of high-cost credit products, we are exploring why relatively lower cost, mid-price, lower risk credit options are not more widely available even accepting the importance of assessing creditworthiness. We have been looking at barriers to the provision of alternatives and have been considering what might be done to address these.
Increasing the options available will help reduce the risks of poor outcomes for consumers, in particular through reducing the incidence of people paying more for a product than they would with an alternative provider.
The FCA has set out a series of commitments on initiatives to support greater consumer access to alternatives to high-cost credit. This includes working with government to clarify our expectations of social landlords and others so that they can feel confident in signposting their clients to alternatives to high-cost credit. The FCA will also highlight best practice that lowers the demand for high-cost credit, such as providing white goods when tenants move into a new property. The FCA is also inviting innovators in this space to bring forward ideas that are in the interest of consumers and test them if necessary as part of the FCA Sandbox.
I am not convinced that currently we have an appropriate system in this country for the sustainable supply of such credit. The FCA alone cannot make this happen, but we have started discussions using our ability to convene to see what might be possible and how stakeholders could work together. I would strongly encourage participation. We could do something here for the public good.
Our approach to regulating consumer credit firms
I want to end with some thoughts on how we do our job. A year ago, we were consulting on our proposed Mission statement, the final version of which we issued last April. Many organisations and individuals, including the FLA participated in that consultation, for which I am grateful.
I can’t do justice to your response, but here are some of the points you made:
Clear regulation is important, and there is a mis-match between the Consumer Credit Act and the rest of our powers.
Two-way communication with the FCA is too difficult for small firms, the large majority of our 57,000. Consequently, it is hard for small firms to identify proposals to change regulation, and there is a real risk they will become discouraged and leave the market. Larger firms with dedicated supervisors may thereby enjoy a competitive advantage.
The FCA should try to avoid being seen as the fixer for a whole raft of social policy issues, but we should at least in some areas seek to work with those who have more direct responsibility.
We should publish our sector views, giving our assessment of each sector we regulate (something that we did last April).
We are following up the publication of our Mission with work on the effectiveness of our major functions, including supervision. We will publish our approach to supervision next month. We are focusing our work here more around business models and governance and firm culture as drivers of harm to our objectives. We are moving to supervise firms as groups or portfolios with comparable business models. The portfolios will not be static because we recognise that business models do change.
For each portfolio of firms, we will regularly agree the principal risks to consumers or markets that the group of firms presents, our programme of work to mitigate these risks, and the steps we will require firms to take. We will maintain contact to ensure that firms understand our assessment and the actions we are seeking. There will be a named supervisor for each portfolio, so you will have a named contact.
We will be proportionate in our approach, and we will do this by assessing the potential risks to customers, the scale of likely possible harm and the potential vulnerability of those customers.
Finally, on the Consumer Credit Act, we are reviewing the appropriateness of the retained provisions, and whether they provide the sort of consumer protection we regard as appropriate today. This is not really an issue about more or less protection, but about adapting older provisions for today’s world. We will publish an Interim Report this summer.
Conclusion
Let me sum up. We have a lot going on. I have to be honest with you; I think the agenda we now see on consumer credit is a lot bigger than the one the FCA saw in 2014 when it took over responsibility. This is a product of experience. But it is also a reflection of just how important Consumer Credit is to our society. It merits careful attention.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority
New credit card rules introduced by the FCA,Press Releases,27/02/2018,27/02/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/new-credit-card-rules-introduced-fca,"The new rules come into force on 1 March 2018, but firms have until 1 September 2018 to comply. The changes will provide more protection for credit card customers in persistent debt or at risk of financial difficulties.
The changes are being introduced following a comprehensive study of the credit card market. The study analysed the accounts of 34 million credit card customers over a period of five years, and surveyed almost 40,000 consumers.
Christopher Woolard, Director of Strategy and Competition said:
'These new rules will significantly reduce the numbers of customers with problem credit card debt. Credit cards offer customers flexibility to manage their finances and repayments, but with this there is a risk customers can build up and hold debt over a long period of time - without making much headway on the outstanding balance.
'Under these new rules firms will have to help customers to break the cycle of persistent debt and ensure customers who cannot afford to repay more quickly, are given help.'
Figures show that customers in persistent debt pay on average around £2.50 in interest and charges for every £1 that they repay of their borrowing. There are a total of 4 million accounts in persistent debt and firms have few incentives to help these customers because they are profitable.
Under these new rules firms will be required to take a series of escalating steps to help customers who are making low repayments over a long period, beginning when the customer has been in persistent debt over 18 months. After this time firms need to contact customers prompting them to change their repayment and informing them their card may ultimately be suspended if they do not change their repayment pattern.
Once a consumer has been in persistent debt for 36 months, their provider will have to offer them a way to repay their balance in a reasonable period. If they are unable to repay the firm must show the customer forbearance. This may include reducing, waiving or cancelling any interest, fees or charges.  
Firms who do not comply with the new rules could be subject to action by the FCA.
Credit card firms have also agreed to voluntary measures, which will give customers control over increases to their credit limit. Under the measures agreed by credit card firms customers can opt-out from receiving automatic credit limit increases. Customers in persistent debt for 12 months will not be offered credit limit increases, this should result in around 1.4m accounts per year not receiving such offers.

"The FCA fines Vanquis £1,976,000 and orders Vanquis to pay compensation to customers",Press Releases,27/02/2018,27/02/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-vanquis-1976000-and-orders-vanquis-pay-compensation-customers,"When selling the ROP, Vanquis told customers how the product worked and what the monthly charge was but did not inform customers that the full cost of the product included an interest component where there was an end of month unpaid balance on their credit card.
The FCA has ordered Vanquis to pay back the interest customers were charged on the ROP from 1 April 2014 to when customers were informed of the full cost of the ROP. Vanquis has voluntarily agreed to pay back the interest customers were charged on the ROP from June 2003 to 31 March 2014, because before this time the FCA was not responsible for regulating the consumer credit market.
Since June 2003 the ROP was offered to all Vanquis credit card customers as a way of helping them to manage their account. The ROP was a credit management tool that permitted customers to freeze their credit card account, take a payment holiday for one month per year, utilise a lifeline that would avoid late fees for one month per year, and receive SMS alerts relevant to their account.
Mark Steward, Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:
'Vanquis failed to make sure customers were informed about the full cost of the ROP when it was offered to customers. Most Vanquis customers chose the ROP to help manage their credit without realising instead that the product might lead to their indebtedness increasing. Customers are entitled to be told all relevant information when being offered financial products. These were very serious breaches. 
'Vanquis has decided now to do the right thing by acknowledging the wrong-doing and offering to compensate its customers. We are pleased the firm has extended the compensation to customers who purchased the ROP before we took responsibility for regulating the consumer credit market.'
In 100 per cent of calls reviewed by the FCA, sales agents did not explain the full cost of the product to customers. Although the firm’s sales agents explained that the principal cost of the ROP was a monthly charge of either £1.29 or £1.19 per £100 of a customer’s outstanding balance, they did not explain to customers that the ROP could attract interest at the card rate, which was compounded unless the account balance was paid in full at the end of the month. The APR on the card could vary from 19.9% to 79.9%. Therefore customers did not have all relevant information to make an informed decision when purchasing the ROP.
The FCA requested Vanquis to freeze sales of the ROP in April 2016. Through a customer contact exercise in late 2016 Vanquis disclosed to its customers the full cost of the ROP and gave customers the opportunity to cancel it.
The FCA found that the firm breached Principle 6 (Customers' interests) & 7 (Communications with clients) of the FCA Principles for Businesses.
Customers who had this product do not need to do anything. They will be contacted by the firm directly in due course.
Vanquis is a credit card lender and a subsidiary of Provident Financial plc, a FTSE 250 company, with approximately 1.7 million customers.
The level of the penalty imposed by the FCA was reduced from £2,822,900 to £1,976,000. This is because Vanquis agreed it had breached the Principles and so was eligible for a 30 per cent discount.

From Diocletian to pay day loans: what can we learn from successful and unsuccessful price regulation?,Speeches,27/02/2018,27/02/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/diocletian-pay-day-loans-what-can-we-learn-successful-and-unsuccessful-price-regulation,"Speaker: Mary Starks, Director of Competition and EconomicsLocation: Social Market Foundation (SMF) lecture, LondonDelivered on: 27 February 2017
Highlights
Fixing or capping prices can have very serious unintended consequences.
Policy makers should review price caps regularly to make sure they work as intended.
Price regulation is a public policy decision that can create both winners and losers.
Note: This is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version.
Let me take you back to the times of the Emperor Diocletian in the Roman Empire, around the end of the third century AD. Diocletian brought in a number of reforms that changed Roman society for the better: changing the structure of the government and creating more equitable taxation. He also, had the radical idea to curb inflation via price controls.
Perhaps the ancient equivalent of announcing a significant policy reform at midnight, on Twitter.
Diocletian’s edict on maximum prices tried to contain the ‘frenzied avarice’ of ‘unscrupulous’ traders by declaring maximum prices for around 1,000 retail items across the empire, disregarding any considerations of supply and demand, or transportation costs.
As you can imagine, it was not long before black markets flourished. After a short and ineffective period, the edict was abolished.
My point is that for at least 1700 years, controlling prices has appealed to policy makers, but has proved tricky in practice.
I often get asked whether the FCA is a ‘price regulator’. It’s a deceptively straightforward question.
I’d love to give a simple yes or no answer and finish the speech here, but the answer is it depends (I am an economist after all).
Unlike some other regulators (Ofcom, Ofgem and the other utility regulators), we do not have formal, regular price reviews built into our remit. In this sense, we are not a price regulator.
We can regulate price in some situations. The important question is: when should we?
Our remit is to promote competition in the interests of consumers, to safeguard market integrity, and to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers. In advancing these objectives, there have been some instances where the FCA has intervened to set a cap on certain prices charged to consumers. So clearly we can regulate price in some situations. The important question is: when should we?
I will discuss this in three parts today. First I’ll look at some other examples of successful and less successful price regulation, and draw some lessons. I’ll then talk about the cases in which FCA does control prices directly. Thirdly, I will talk more broadly about why FCA cares about price, and how we think about intervening. This can be indirectly – to shape the forces that bear upon price, or directly - to set, cap or otherwise control price.
The topic is both technically complex and politically charged. For the last 30 years or so, since the privatisation and liberalisation of the Thatcher years, the strong orthodoxy in economic policy circles has been that price control comes in only when there is no hope of getting competition to do the job - that competition is always preferable to price control. However, that orthodoxy is now under challenge from across the political spectrum, and we have seen the re-emergence of price controls for pre-payment customers in energy, and a lively debate about extending caps further.
Lessons from rent controls
Turning to another page of history, let’s jump forward to the Second World War, when President Franklin D Roosevelt introduced the Emergency Price Control Act to counter the inflationary pressures of full wartime employment.
One of the consequences of the Act was to freeze New York rents at their 1943 levels. Despite the normalisation of the economy following the end of the war, the Act was replaced with new laws that retained price controls on rents, and there have been variations of these controls since then.
While this has helped keep rents low for people in rent-controlled flats, it has had the opposite effect for everyone else.
Forcing rents below the market level has led to landlords withdrawing housing stock, and reduced the incentive to build more housing. This has contributed to housing shortages, pushing non-controlled rents up. As in Diocletian’s time, these price controls also led to market forces expressing themselves in other forms, such as landlords taking under the table payments or instituting high sign-up fees.
While rent control appeals as a way to curb landlords’ profitmaking at tenants’ expense, most economists agree that the unintended consequences seriously undermine the goal of affordable housing. In fact, Paul Krugman has said that rent control is among the best-understood issues in all of economics, and—among economists, anyway - one of the least controversial. This is not to say rent control can never work  but the unintended consequences have to be recognised and addressed.
So why is the policy still in place, more than 70 years after the end of the war? And why did the current mayor, Bill de Blasio, campaign for rent freezes in 2013? The policy appeals to tenants, promising lower prices, greater certainty, and maintaining the city's character, and to unwind the policy could be seen as appeasing landlords and punishing tenants.
Fixing or capping prices can have very serious unintended consequences, including undermining the very intent of the policy and fuelling black market or other criminal activity.
I want to draw two lessons from history before we move on to financial services and the present day. First, fixing or capping prices can have very serious unintended consequences, including undermining the very intent of the policy and fuelling black market or other criminal activity. Secondly, once a policy is in place, even if it proves to be bad policy, it can become entrenched – the direct beneficiaries are deeply vested, while those who lose out are harmed indirectly and invisibly. The politics runs counter to the economics.
Both Diocletian and FDR deployed price control rein in inflation. These days we deal with inflation through other means, and most policy discussions about price control are microeconomic – they are about prices for particular goods and services.
The obvious example of this is in utilities, where price control has been used to curb monopoly power. The track record of price regulation in utilities, in the UK and internationally, has been well studied and could fill an entire lecture series.. I'm going to move right on to financial services.
Price caps and controls in financial services
Financial services infrastructure – notably the payments system and securities trading infrastructure (exchanges, clearing houses etc.) – can have elements of monopoly power and network effects. There are various complex, arcane and in some cases disputed issues I could go into here, but I’ll pick just one – interchange fees.
If you are a competition economist or lawyer, you will know what these are because you will at some point in your career have been paid to understand them. If you are a normal person, the interchange fee is one of the most ubiquitous prices you have never seen. When you pay with plastic for, say, a loaf of bread, the baker's bank pays your bank an interchange fee. The fee is set by the card scheme, Mastercard or Visa. And for reasons that a competition economist or lawyer can explain to you over the least enjoyable pint of beer of your life, competition tends to drive these fees up not down.
Much of the developed world tried to tackle interchange fees using competition law, which was fiendishly complicated and thus extremely lucrative for competition advisers, even if it didn't do much for their pub banter.
However, Australia took a different tack. The Reserve Bank of Australia set up a Board with the power to cap interchange fees for credit cards. Since 2006 this has been capped at 0.50 per cent of the value of the transaction for both Visa and Mastercard.
When these caps were proposed, some firms cautioned that it would crush the credit card industry. Reducing the amount of revenue firms could earn through interchange fees would cut margins and force firms out of the market.
However, two subsequent reviews by the Reserve Bank of Australia, in 2008 and 2015, have confirmed that the cap appears to be addressing the distortions in the market without critically impairing the credit card industry. Similar regimes have subsequently been introduced in the US (in 2011) and the EU (in 2013).
So price control has proved more effective than competition, in this instance. What did the Australians do right? First, they diagnosed the problem correctly (if counter-intuitively) – it was not a cartel-like problem for which competition law was well suited; it was a market power problem to which price capping is well suited. Second, they committed to reviewing the policy at regular intervals. As it happened, the policy did not have the unintended consequence of crushing the credit card industry, but if it had they would have spotted it early.
Price regulation in the context of utilities or financial infrastructure is primarily motivated by concerns about monopoly or market power.
Price regulation in the context of utilities or financial infrastructure is primarily motivated by concerns about monopoly or market power – companies that enjoy a privileged and unassailable position, and whose ability to over-charge their customers must therefore be reined in.
But most financial services markets don’t look like that. Most financial services markets have multiple players. Most regulation of retail financial services is primarily motivated by the complex, long-term and high stakes nature of the products. If you buy a lousy loaf of bread, you go to a different baker next time.
So why has price regulation become ‘a thing’ in these markets?
Price regulation by the FCA
In recent years the FCA has introduced price regulation in three areas: on high-cost short-term credit in 2014, workplace personal pension schemes in 2015, and early exit pension charges in 2016.
In each of these cases the duty to regulate prices was placed on the FCA by the government. So while, in theory, we are able to initiate price regulation using our own powers, we have not done so since our inception in 2013. This is significant. As the New York rent control example illustrates, there are often winners and losers from price control. Policies that create losers as well as winners involve difficult political choices as well as technocratic design challenges.
In the high-cost short-term credit market, we imposed a set of caps on the fees and charges that can be levied on borrowers: a daily interest cap of 0.8%, a default fees cap of £15, and a total cost cap of 100% of the principal. We imposed a range of other measures at the same time.
Why cap the price of high-cost short-term credit? There were lots of lenders in the market at the time. But competition on price was weak – borrowers were not shopping around or comparing prices, partly because this was difficult, but also because they wanted credit urgently. Borrowers who needed cash immediately were less concerned with what credit cost, and were lent money without much discipline around whether they could afford to borrow. Many then faced excessive fees and charges when they couldn’t repay, suffered egregious collection practices, and found themselves trapped in debt spirals.
You'll recall that one of the unintended consequences of Diocletian’s price edict was to drive activity into the black market. One of the main debates around the high-cost short-term credit price cap was whether it would have a similar effect, driving borrowers into the arms of illegal money lenders.
Following in the footsteps of the Reserve Bank of Australia, we recently reviewed the impact of the cap. We found that 60% of people rejected for high-cost short-term credit did not go on to borrow from other sources. The rest mainly went to friends or family, with 15% using other forms of formal credit.
What else did the review tell us? The market is now smaller. In 2016, 800,000 people took out 3.6 million loans to the value of £1.1 billion. That might sound a lot but it is less than half the size it was in 2013. But, vitally, consumers are paying less for loans and are better able to repay them on time.
For workplace personal pension schemes, we imposed, among other measures, a fee cap of 0.75% for default schemes used by firms to meet the automatic enrolment duty. We also prohibited firms from price discrimination based on whether their members currently contribute to the funds. This example is interesting for three reasons. First, it combines price control and nudge – those customers who do not make an active choice find themselves in a price-capped default scheme contributing at the auto-enrolment rate. However firms are free to develop and market other options at other price points but they can only win customers via active choice.
Secondly, we took steps to protect a particular group that might be even less engaged, and without an employer looking out for their interests – former employees who remain scheme members but are no longer contributing. We banned firms from charging these customers more than they charge active members.
Thirdly, and incredibly important, the Government established a supplier of last resort: NEST. By the way, I use supplier of last resort in the policy wonk sense, I am not trying to be rude about NEST – far from it. This protects against one of the most serious unintended consequences of price capping – that some customers become unattractive or even uneconomic to serve. In the pensions market, which typically charges ad valorem fees, these are customers with small pots. There are quite a lot of these, particularly as we are in the early days of auto-enrolment.
Lastly, for contract-based personal pensions, we introduced an early exit charges cap of 1% of the pot. There was a political imperative here to ensure people did not have to pay hefty fees to access the new pension freedoms, a flagship government policy.
We can and do cap prices. But this is the exception not the rule. Across the financial services sector there are tens of thousands of prices set every day by market forces where we do not intervene directly.
But the case is also interesting as an example of capping what Which? has called ‘sneaky fees and charges‘. This is distinct from capping the headline price. One argument for capping less visible fees and charges is that it prevents a competitive dynamic taking hold where there is fierce competition on the headline price, but firms look to recover cost through other fees and charges, including those buried in the small print. I’m sure many of you will recognise this phenomenon from airlines or car hire.
So we can and do cap prices. But this is the exception not the rule. Across the financial services sector there are tens of thousands of prices set everyday by market forces where we do not intervene directly.
How we might use price regulation in the future
So in what circumstances could you make a sensible case for intervening directly to regulate price?
As I mentioned, prevailing orthodoxy was, until recently, that price control was an absolute last resort, only to be tried if all other attempts to boost competition had failed. I basically stand by that.
However, what has become apparent more recently is that competition can drive uneven benefits, and (to paraphrase the old Heineken ads), there are parts of some markets that competition cannot reach. In these cases competition works powerfully to drive prices down for some, but this can be at the expense of higher prices for others. Typically, savvy bargain hunters (or, as we call them in financial services, Martin Lewis readers) do very well, while customers who are less active or ‘engaged’ can do quite badly. Where the goods and services in question are in some sense essential (which is not the case for fashionable restaurants but is the case for many financial services), this undermines confidence in markets as a mechanism for delivery. And where the less engaged are also in some sense vulnerable (for example on low incomes), this is a particularly serious problem.
However, price control is not the only possible policy response. There may be ways to target protection or assistance to vulnerable or at-risk customers specifically. There may be ways to create independent oversight or governance arrangements so that iniquitous pricing practices are challenged and driven out. This was the thinking behind the creation of Independent Governance Committees for workplace pensions, and the governance element of our recent reforms in the asset management sector.
There are, to my mind, two main issues with using price control to protect less ‘engaged’ or ‘savvy’ consumers. The first is the risk of unintended consequences. If you make it less commercially rewarding (or more onerous in compliance terms) to serve vulnerable consumers, fewer firms will want to do it. Having suppliers back away from these customers would be an own goal The second is that unwinding price discrimination creates losers as well as winners, and deciding how far to go requires a view on what is a fair outcome. Regulators tend to prefer that call to be made by elected representatives. Elected representatives may want regulators to be bolder.
Is the FCA a price regulator?
So, is the FCA a price regulator? Well, not in the sense of our colleagues at other regulators who regularly review many of the prices in their remit. We see no reason to intervene directly in most of the thousands of prices that are set every day in financial services markets.
We are concerned when these markets are not working well, for some or all customers, we will generally first look to other policy options to improve the way that competition works. But, clearly there are times when we intervene directly to protect customers, including by controlling prices.
And there will doubtless be further occasions when price control is ‘on the table’ as an option. In those discussions, I will be saying three things.
Simply capping prices can create more losers than winners, and measures intended to help the vulnerable can achieve the opposite.
First, our previous examples have illustrated that price control can mean many, quite different things:  from a headline price cap (as with payday lending), to a cap on the price of a default option, (as with auto-enrolment), to a ban on price discrimination between particular groups (as with active and inactive members of a pension scheme), to a cap on small print fees and charges (as with early exit fees). As a crude generalisation, the risk of really serious unintended consequences is probably highest for the first, and lowest for the last.
Which brings me to the second: beware the unintended consequences. The ones I have discussed are restricting supply, making customers - sometimes vulnerable ones - uneconomic to serve, and fuelling black market activity. There are others.
Unintended consequences are not insurmountable. But in designing policy, you need to identify and do something about them. And having implemented the policy, you need to check it is working. Review the impact of the policy thoroughly and soon. And if it is not working as it should, think again.
Third: recognise that these are public policy decisions, with winners and losers. Sometimes that means the final call is rightly the preserve of elected politicians, not appointed regulators.
The 'frenzied avarice of unscrupulous traders' makes us angry, and rightly so. But simply capping their prices can create more losers than winners, and measures intended to help the vulnerable can achieve the opposite. Regulators and think-tanks like the SMF need to call this out.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority
FCA statement on proposals to introduce a public register,Statements,26/02/2018,26/02/2018,2018-10-04,https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-statement-proposals-introduce-public-register,"The FCA and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) currently maintain a public Financial Services Register, “the FS Register', of the firms we regulate and the individuals we have approved.
In July 2017, the FCA published proposals to extend the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR) to almost all regulated firms.
Under these proposals, the FCA will only approve the most senior individuals within firms. This means that only Senior Managers will appear on the FS Register. Firms are responsible for assessing the fitness and propriety of their employees and ‘certifying’ certain individuals who are not Senior Managers, but whose jobs mean they can still have a significant impact on customers, firms and market integrity.
In response to these proposals, the FCA received substantial feedback on the public value of the FCA maintaining a central public record of certification employees and other important individuals in firms regulated by the FCA who will no longer appear on the FS Register. This includes non-executive directors, financial advisers, traders and portfolio managers.
The FCA has listened to this feedback and will consult by summer 2018 on policy proposals to address this feedback. In addition, the FCA plans to issue an update shortly on its work to improve the usability of the FS register, which incorporates feedback from the Work and Pensions Select Committee.",6 - Financial Conduct Authority
