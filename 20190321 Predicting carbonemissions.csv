With the transition to deregulated electricity tariffs (NOME Act, New Organization of the Electricity Market), Gecina has incorporated into its contracts a clause stipulating that a portion of its power supply must come from french renewable energy. Currently, this electricity is exclusively from hydraulic production, emitting 6 gCO2/kWh while the electricity without guarantee of origin emits 6 to 30 times more emission Use energy supply methods that limit direct emissions (scope 1), or indirect emissions (scope 2), by undertaking work to improve the facilities of the buildings in operation. Dedicated budgets are allocated in order to implement lower GHG emitting eco-variants for each technical installation to be replaced. For example, fuel oil boilers are replaced by other systems (networks, natural gas) for greater energy efficiency and a lower carbon footprint (this criterion takes precedence over the first). As a result, connection to urban networks that emit lower levels of greenhouse gases, for example the Paris CPCU network (175 gCO2/kWh) or the Idex network, in Boulogne-Billancourt (103 gCO2/kWh) are favored over natural gas solutions (300 gCO2/kWh) or electric solutions (180 gCO2/kWh). Likewise, the use of urban cooling networks, like the Climespace network (40 gCO2/kWh), substantially improves the footprint of the properties compared to an electrical solution.",23.21,Market-based,91,164,75,94,37,81,43,56,71,67,68,69,68,114,122,97,109,97,79,121,46,82,46,94,53,34,74,52,82,59,60,0.05,0.13,0.12,0.17,0.19,0.06,fr0010040865,0.015006252,0.010226662,0.011763147,0.012511301,0.526566416,23.20524638

The allocation of GHG emissions is completed through using emission factors applied to each unit of energy consumption. The two methods are the location-based method which indicates the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs, while the other is the market-based method which reflects emissions from electricity provided by utility companies. The former uses grid average emission factors while the latter uses supplier-specific emission factors in order to define scope 2 emissions.These two methods together make up the Dual Reporting structure for scope 2 that has become the industry standard for corporations when they report scope 2 emissions. Historically, CRH used only one single emission factor for all types of electricity (purchased non-renewable, purchased renewable and onsite generated renewable) Starting 2016, CRH also follows the Dual Reporting structure of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, but since the company does not centrally collect product or supplier-specific data from its 3,800 operating locations, it uses only location-based method (U.S. data is on state-based factors given by eGRID while the rest of the world is on the International Energy Agency’s grid factors) in order to calculate scope 2 emissions in 2016.",906.68,Location-based,165,78,40,108,83,91,75,77,95,56,113,81,81,106,98,55,100,55,100,53,106,0,37,78,43,73,30,224,50,48,111,0.13,0.30,0.18,0.19,0.09,0.27,ie0001827041,0.019671169,0.012589726,0.015572681,0.014162048,0.461403509,906.6787558

This method takes into account the use of renewable electricity with an emissions factor of 0 g CO2e/MWh. This sharp decrease in 2016 is thanks to a decrease in electricity consumption and an increase of renewable electricity purchased, in particular in Poland, meaning a shift from a heavy coal-mix in the grid. Using the Location-based method outlined within the Scope 2 Guidance, our scope 2 CO2e emissions for our base-year (2014) is 123 kilotonnes and for 2016 is 112 kilotonnes. This means that we have reduced our location-based scope 2 emissions by 9% since 2014.

This statement also attests that SCS Global Services can provide reasonable assurance that Owens Corning’s reported Scope1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016 are in all material respects in accordance with the reporting criteria. Furthermore, SCS Global Services can provide limited assurance, based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, that no matters have come to the attention of the audit team to cause the verification body to believe that Owens Corning’s reported Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016 were materially misstated.SCS applies the International Standard ISO 14065:2013 - Requirements for greenhouse gas validation and verification bodies for use in accreditation or other forms of recognition and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.In accordance with the requirements of ISAE 3000, SCS has complied with the commercial independence and other ethical requirements of the International Standard ISO 14065:2013 - Requirements for greenhouse gas validation and verification bodies for use in accreditation or other forms of recognition, which is founded on fundamental principles of impartiality, competence, objective decision making, openness, and confidentiality.",695.44,Market-based,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.32,0.32,0.25,0.28,0.31,0.32,us6907421019,0.015198619,0.012243164,0.020293436,0.020019132,0.224310777,695.4405496
